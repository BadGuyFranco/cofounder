# Single Source of Truth

## The Rule

**Never duplicate instructions. Always reference the authoritative source.**

## Documentation Hierarchy

| Question | Source of Truth |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Quick project orientation** | `CONTEXT.md` (workspace root) |
| Core philosophy, principles | `docs/PRINCIPLES.md` |
| Code patterns, module structure | `AGENTS.md` |
| Why a decision was made | `docs/architecture/decisions/` |
| What's implemented, what's next | `docs/PROGRESS.md` |
| How to contribute | `CONTRIBUTING.md` |
| UI styling, visual patterns | `docs/patterns/ui-patterns.md` |

## When Writing Code or Docs

- Before explaining a pattern: "Is this documented elsewhere?"
- If yes → reference it, don't repeat it
- If no → add it to the appropriate source, then reference

## When You See Duplication

Challenge it:
> "This duplicates what's in [source]. Should we reference instead of repeat?"

## Cursor Rules Purpose

Rules are **guardrails**, not textbooks. They should:
- State the constraint (1-2 lines)
- Point to the source of truth
- Give one red-flag example

Rules should NOT contain detailed tutorials—that's what docs are for.
