# Presentation Structure

How to arc a presentation for maximum impact. Structure is the difference between a collection of slides and a story that moves people.

## The Core Principle

Every presentation is an argument. The structure should make the conclusion feel inevitable, not announced.

## Structural Arcs by Use Case

Select the arc that matches the presentation's purpose. Each arc defines the sequence of narrative beats, not individual slides. A single beat may span 1-5 slides.

### Business Pitch

Goal: Secure a decision (investment, partnership, purchase).

1. **Hook** -- A surprising fact, provocative question, or vivid scenario that makes the audience feel the problem
2. **Problem** -- Define the pain. Make it specific and quantifiable. The audience should think "yes, that's exactly right."
3. **Stakes** -- What happens if the problem persists? Create urgency without fear-mongering.
4. **Solution** -- Your approach. Position it as the natural resolution to the tension you've built.
5. **Proof** -- Evidence that it works. Case studies, data, testimonials. Match proof type to audience skepticism level.
6. **How it works** -- Enough detail to build credibility, not so much it becomes a tutorial.
7. **Ask** -- Clear call to action. What do you want them to do, and what happens next?

### Technical Talk

Goal: Transfer knowledge and build credibility.

1. **Context** -- Why this topic matters right now. Connect to something the audience already cares about.
2. **Problem statement** -- The specific technical challenge. Be precise.
3. **Prior art** -- What exists, what works, what doesn't. Show you've done the homework.
4. **Approach** -- Your solution. Explain the key insight, not just the implementation.
5. **Demo/walkthrough** -- Show it working. Code, architecture, live demo.
6. **Trade-offs** -- What you gained, what you gave up. Honest assessment builds trust.
7. **Takeaways** -- What the audience should do with this knowledge.

### Educational / Workshop

Goal: Enable the audience to do something new.

1. **Why this matters** -- Motivation. Connect to the learner's goals.
2. **Current state** -- Where the audience is today. Acknowledge their existing knowledge.
3. **Concept introduction** -- One new concept at a time. Define, explain, illustrate.
4. **Guided practice** -- Walk through an example together.
5. **Common mistakes** -- What goes wrong and how to recover. This is where trust is built.
6. **Independent application** -- Challenge or exercise for the audience.
7. **Summary and resources** -- Reinforce key points. Provide next steps for continued learning.

### Strategy / Board Deck

Goal: Align stakeholders and secure approval.

1. **Executive summary** -- The entire story in one slide. Decision-makers may not stay for the whole deck.
2. **Context** -- Market conditions, competitive landscape, internal situation.
3. **Opportunity / threat** -- What prompted this strategy. Make it concrete.
4. **Recommended approach** -- What you propose and why.
5. **Supporting analysis** -- Data, models, scenarios. Enough to validate, not overwhelm.
6. **Resource requirements** -- What it costs (time, money, people).
7. **Risk assessment** -- What could go wrong and how you'll mitigate.
8. **Decision request** -- Exactly what you need approved.

### General / Flexible

When the presentation doesn't fit a specific type, use the universal structure:

1. **Open** -- Earn attention. Hook, context, or surprising insight.
2. **Setup** -- Establish the framework. What is this about and why now?
3. **Body** -- 3-5 main points, each with evidence. Follow the rule of three when possible.
4. **Turn** -- The "so what" moment. Synthesize the points into a larger insight.
5. **Close** -- Clear takeaway and call to action.

## Audience Calibration

The same content needs different structural emphasis depending on the audience.

| Audience | Emphasize | De-emphasize |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Executives | Summary, decision, ROI | Technical detail, methodology |
| Technical | Architecture, trade-offs, code | High-level vision, branding |
| Investors | Market size, traction, team | Product minutiae, implementation |
| Learners | Concepts, examples, practice | Competitive positioning, sales |
| Mixed | Layered detail (overview first, drill-down optional) | Jargon in either direction |

## Slide Count Guidelines

These are starting points, not rules. Adjust based on density and delivery context.

| Duration | Approximate Slides | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| 5 min | 8-12 | Lightning talk. One idea. |
| 15 min | 15-25 | Focused topic. Tight pacing. |
| 30 min | 25-40 | Full presentation. Room for depth. |
| 45-60 min | 35-60 | Keynote length. Include breathing room. |
| Workshop | Varies | Dense sections need more slides at slower pace. |

The "one slide per minute" rule is a rough average. Some slides stay up for 30 seconds (transitions, images); others stay for 3 minutes (data, code walkthrough).

## Pacing Rhythm

Alternate between high-density and low-density slides to maintain attention.

**High-density slides** (text, code, data tables): require the audience to read and process. Limit to 2-3 in a row before a break.

**Low-density slides** (single statements, images, section dividers): give the audience a cognitive break. Use between dense sections.

**Pattern:**
```
Dense > Dense > Breather > Dense > Dense > Breather > Section Break
```

Never stack more than three consecutive dense slides without a visual or cognitive break.
