# Proposal Author

Craft the strategic content and persuasive structure of proposals. This tool produces raw text, not formatted documents. It is the thinking and writing engine; use Presentation Builder or Documentor to turn the output into slide decks, PDFs, or formatted deliverables.

## Documentation

See **AGENTS.md** for complete instructions, methodology, and usage.

## How It Works

**Phase 1: Discovery.** Collaborative questioning extracts your offer's strongest elements: proof points, objection responses, transformation arc, and competitive positioning. Everything gets distilled into a ranked Top 10 and saved as a Base Proposal, a reusable strategic asset.

**Phase 2: Audience-Specific Proposals.** Point to a Base Proposal and describe the target audience. The tool profiles their buying psychology, selects persuasion triggers, and generates a proposal structured with cognitive layering, a 6-layer framework where each section earns the reader's permission to present the next.

## What Powers It

Three frameworks work together:

- **Cognitive Layering.** 6-layer structure (Shared Reality, Specific Understanding, Unique Perspective, Proof, Future Vision, Natural Offer) that builds compounding buy-in. Each layer secures a micro-commitment before advancing.
- **SPARK Adaptation.** Transition techniques between layers that maintain reader momentum and prevent drop-off.
- **Psychology Triggers.** Audience-matched persuasion mechanisms (loss aversion, social proof, future pacing, authority, specificity) with ethical boundaries.

## Common Use Cases

- Client proposals and pitch documents
- Partnership and investment proposals
- Speaking engagement pitches
- Internal strategy proposals
- Any persuasive document targeting a specific audience
