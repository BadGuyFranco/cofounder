# Cognitive Layering

The structural backbone for proposals that build compounding buy-in.

**This is the source of truth for the 6-layer structure.** Load when generating any proposal.

## Core Principle

Each layer earns the right to present the next. By the final layer, "yes" feels inevitable because every previous layer secured a micro-commitment. The reader doesn't feel sold to; they feel understood, then convinced, then ready.

## The 6 Layers

| Layer | Name | Purpose | Reader's Internal Shift |
|-------|------|---------|------------------------|
| 1 | Shared Reality | Establish the problem or opportunity | "They get it" |
| 2 | Specific Understanding | Show you understand THEIR situation | "They get ME" |
| 3 | Unique Perspective | Why conventional approaches fall short | "This is different" |
| 4 | Proof | Evidence this approach works | "This actually works" |
| 5 | Future Vision | Paint their transformed state | "I want that" |
| 6 | Natural Offer | The ask as logical conclusion | "Of course, let's do this" |

## Layer Details

### Layer 1: Shared Reality

**Goal:** Establish that you see the same problem they see.

The reader should finish this section thinking, "Yes, that's exactly the situation." You're not teaching them about their problem; you're naming what they already know but haven't articulated.

**What to include:**
- The problem or opportunity, stated in their language
- Why it matters (consequences, stakes, missed potential)
- Implicit acknowledgment that others have tried and failed

**What to avoid:**
- Generic problem statements that could apply to anyone
- Lecturing or explaining what they already know
- Rushing to your solution

**Transition:** End with tension. The problem is clear, but resolution is not. Pull the reader into Layer 2.

### Layer 2: Specific Understanding

**Goal:** Prove you understand their specific situation, not just the general problem.

The reader should finish this section thinking, "They get ME, not just my industry/role." This is where generic proposals die. Specificity builds trust.

**What to include:**
- Details specific to their context (industry, role, company stage)
- Recognition of their constraints and pressures
- Acknowledgment of what they've probably already tried

**What to avoid:**
- Assumptions stated as facts (use "you may have found" not "you've found")
- Generic audience descriptions
- Moving too quickly to your solution

**Transition:** The problem is clear, their situation is understood. Now they're ready to hear why conventional approaches fail.

### Layer 3: Unique Perspective

**Goal:** Reframe how they see the problem and position your approach as the logical response.

The reader should finish this section thinking, "This is different from what I've seen before." You're not attacking competitors; you're shifting the frame so your approach becomes inevitable.

**What to include:**
- Why the conventional approach (or their current approach) falls short
- A reframe or insight that changes how they see the problem
- Introduction of your unique approach as the natural response

**What to avoid:**
- Direct competitor attacks (reframe, don't trash)
- Claims without grounding
- Technical details that lose the narrative

**Transition:** The new perspective creates curiosity. Does this approach actually work? Pull into Layer 4.

### Layer 4: Proof

**Goal:** Provide evidence that your approach delivers results.

The reader should finish this section thinking, "This actually works." Select proof relevant to THIS audience. An enterprise case study may hurt a startup pitch. Match proof to reader.

**What to include:**
- Results, metrics, outcomes (quantified when possible)
- Testimonials or quotes that address this audience's likely concerns
- Case studies with clear before/after
- Pattern evidence ("In working with 30+ companies like yours...")

**What to avoid:**
- Proof that doesn't match the audience
- Vague claims ("great results" without specifics)
- Overwhelming with quantity over relevance

**Transition:** The proof is convincing, but intellectual. Now make it emotional. Pull into Layer 5.

### Layer 5: Future Vision

**Goal:** Help them see and feel their transformed state.

The reader should finish this section thinking, "I want that." This is where the proposal shifts from logical to emotional. Paint their success vividly and specifically.

**What to include:**
- Their specific future state (not generic benefits)
- Concrete details they can visualize
- The feeling of having the problem solved
- What becomes possible once this is handled

**What to avoid:**
- Abstract benefits ("improved efficiency")
- Overselling or unrealistic promises
- Rushing to the offer

**Transition:** They want the outcome. Now make it easy to take the next step. Pull into Layer 6.

### Layer 6: Natural Offer

**Goal:** Present the ask as the obvious next step.

The reader should finish this section thinking, "Of course, let's do this." The offer should feel like a natural conclusion, not a hard sell. They've been prepared through every previous layer.

**What to include:**
- Clear statement of what you're proposing
- Specific next step (not vague "let's talk")
- Risk reversal if appropriate (guarantees, pilots, phased approach)
- Call to action that matches the calibrated intensity

**What to avoid:**
- Introducing new information (everything should already be seeded)
- Pressure tactics that undermine the trust built
- Multiple competing calls to action

## Compounding Buy-In

The power of cognitive layering is compounding agreement. Each layer secures a micro-commitment:

1. "Yes, that's the problem" → Permission to continue
2. "Yes, they understand my situation" → Trust established
3. "Yes, this approach makes sense" → Openness to solution
4. "Yes, it works for others" → Belief it could work for me
5. "Yes, I want that outcome" → Emotional investment
6. "Yes, let's do this" → Commitment

A proposal that skips layers breaks the chain. The reader feels manipulated rather than convinced.

## Layer Transitions

Never let a section close cleanly until Layer 6. Each transition should:
- Resolve the current layer's question
- Create incompleteness that pulls into the next layer
- Use SPARK principles (see `spark-adaptation.md`)

**Weak transition:** "Now let's look at our approach."
**Strong transition:** "But understanding the problem isn't enough. The question is: why do conventional solutions keep failing?"

## Adapting Layer Length

Not all layers need equal weight. Adapt based on:

| Audience State | Layer Emphasis |
|----------------|----------------|
| Problem-aware but solution-unaware | Heavy on Layer 3 (perspective) and 4 (proof) |
| Solution-aware but skeptical | Heavy on Layer 4 (proof) and 5 (vision) |
| Ready to buy but needs justification | Heavy on Layer 4 (proof) and 6 (offer clarity) |
| Unaware of problem | Heavy on Layer 1 (reality) and 2 (understanding) |

## Common Failures

| Failure | Symptom | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Skipping Layer 2 | Feels generic, "they don't get me" | Add specific situation details |
| Weak Layer 3 | "Same as everyone else" | Strengthen the reframe |
| Wrong proof in Layer 4 | Doubt instead of belief | Match proof to audience |
| Abstract Layer 5 | No emotional pull | Add concrete, visualizable details |
| Premature Layer 6 | Feels pushy | Ensure layers 1-5 are complete |
