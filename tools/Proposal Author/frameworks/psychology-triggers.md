# Psychology Triggers

Guide for selecting and applying psychology triggers based on audience profile.

**This is the source of truth for trigger selection.** Load when profiling audience for a proposal.

## Purpose

Psychology triggers are persuasion mechanisms that influence decision-making. Used well, they help readers recognize value and overcome hesitation. Used poorly, they feel manipulative and destroy trust.

The goal is alignment, not manipulation: help the reader see what's genuinely in their interest.

## Available Triggers

### Loss Aversion

People feel losses more strongly than equivalent gains. What they risk by not acting often motivates more than what they gain by acting.

**Application:**
- Frame inaction as a choice with consequences
- Quantify the cost of the status quo
- Show what competitors who act will gain (that they'll miss)

**When to use:** Audiences who are comfortable with status quo, need urgency, or underestimate risk of inaction.

**When to avoid:** Audiences already anxious or overwhelmed; adds stress rather than clarity.

**In proposals:**
- Layer 1: Cost of the problem continuing
- Layer 3: What's lost by conventional approaches
- Layer 6: What's at stake if they don't act

### Social Proof

People look to others' behavior to guide their own, especially in uncertainty.

**Application:**
- Testimonials from similar roles/industries
- Case studies with relatable companies
- Pattern evidence ("30+ companies like yours...")
- Named clients when permitted

**When to use:** Audiences who need validation, face internal skepticism, or are risk-averse.

**When to avoid:** Audiences who pride themselves on being different or first-movers (can backfire).

**In proposals:**
- Layer 4: Primary home for social proof
- Layer 2: Brief mention to establish credibility
- Layer 6: Reference to others who've taken this step

### Future Pacing

Help the reader vividly experience their future state as if it's already happened.

**Application:**
- Describe their transformed situation in present tense
- Include sensory and emotional details
- Show what becomes possible, not just what improves

**When to use:** Ambitious audiences, visionary buyers, those who need to sell internally.

**When to avoid:** Highly analytical audiences who distrust emotion; can feel manipulative.

**In proposals:**
- Layer 5: Primary home for future pacing
- Layer 6: Brief callback to reinforce vision

### Commitment Escalation

Small agreements lead to larger agreements. Each "yes" makes the next more likely.

**Application:**
- Structure proposal so each layer earns a micro-yes
- Start with undeniable statements
- Build agreement before making the ask

**When to use:** All audiences; this is built into cognitive layering structure.

**When to avoid:** Don't overdo explicit agreement-seeking ("You'd agree that..."); let the structure work.

**In proposals:**
- Built into layer structure
- Each layer designed to earn agreement before proceeding

### Authority

People defer to expertise and credibility signals, especially in unfamiliar domains.

**Application:**
- Credentials relevant to their context
- Published work, speaking, recognition
- Experience with similar situations
- Third-party validation

**When to use:** Audiences evaluating expertise, skeptical of claims, or needing to justify to others.

**When to avoid:** Audiences who distrust authority figures; use social proof instead.

**In proposals:**
- Layer 2: Establish you understand their world
- Layer 3: Position as expert on the approach
- Layer 4: Reinforce through proof

### Scarcity (When Authentic)

Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Application:**
- Genuine capacity constraints
- Time-limited offers with real deadlines
- Exclusive access or early-mover advantages

**When to use:** When scarcity is real and relevant to their decision timing.

**When to avoid:** When artificial or manipulative; destroys trust when discovered.

**In proposals:**
- Layer 6: Only if genuinely applicable
- Never fabricate scarcity

### Specificity

Concrete details are more believable than vague claims. Specificity signals truth.

**Application:**
- Exact numbers over round numbers
- Named situations over categories
- Precise timelines over "quickly"
- Detailed process over "we'll handle it"

**When to use:** All audiences; particularly analytical, skeptical, or detail-oriented.

**When to avoid:** Don't overwhelm; be specific about what matters most.

**In proposals:**
- Throughout all layers
- Particularly critical in Layer 4 (proof) and Layer 5 (vision)

### Pattern Interrupts

Breaking expected patterns regains attention and increases memorability.

**Application:**
- Unexpected framing or analogy
- Counterintuitive insight
- Challenge to conventional wisdom
- Structural surprise

**When to use:** Audiences who've seen many proposals, are jaded, or need to be jolted out of assumptions.

**When to avoid:** Conservative audiences who value predictability; can feel gimmicky.

**In proposals:**
- Layer 3: Reframe that shifts perspective
- Transitions: Unexpected questions or statements

## Audience-Based Selection

### Conservative / Risk-Averse Audiences

**Primary triggers:** Authority, social proof, specificity
**Secondary triggers:** Loss aversion (framed as risk mitigation)
**Avoid:** Heavy future pacing, pattern interrupts, artificial scarcity

**Characteristics:** Value stability, need justification, fear making wrong choice.

**Approach:** Build confidence through proof and credibility. Heavy Layer 4. Conservative Layer 5.

### Ambitious / Growth-Oriented Audiences

**Primary triggers:** Future pacing, ambition, loss aversion (opportunity cost)
**Secondary triggers:** Social proof (aspirational comparisons)
**Avoid:** Excessive caution, dwelling on problems

**Characteristics:** Want to win, fear missing out, motivated by potential.

**Approach:** Bold vision in Layer 5. Frame Layer 1 as opportunity, not just problem.

### Skeptical / Analytical Audiences

**Primary triggers:** Specificity, proof-heavy Layer 4, authority
**Secondary triggers:** Social proof (with detailed case studies)
**Avoid:** Emotional appeals, vague claims, pressure tactics

**Characteristics:** Need to verify claims, distrust salespeople, want data.

**Approach:** Over-index on Layer 4. Provide supporting materials. Let them reach conclusions.

### Relationship-Driven Audiences

**Primary triggers:** Recognition, social proof (relationships), liking
**Secondary triggers:** Authority (if through relationship)
**Avoid:** Purely transactional framing, heavy analytics

**Characteristics:** Value trust, prefer working with people they like, consider long-term fit.

**Approach:** Heavy Layer 2 (understanding). Personal in Layer 5. Relationship-focused Layer 6.

### Decision-Maker Under Pressure

**Primary triggers:** Loss aversion, specificity, clear next steps
**Secondary triggers:** Social proof (quick wins), future pacing (relief)
**Avoid:** Long timelines, complex options, excessive detail

**Characteristics:** Need to act, overwhelmed by options, want simplicity.

**Approach:** Streamlined proposal. Clear Layer 6 with simple next step. Emphasize speed to value.

## Anchoring and Packaging

Apply these principles even when the proposal has no explicit pricing.

### Value Anchoring

Establish the value of outcomes before any discussion of investment.

**Application:**
- Quantify the problem cost in Layer 1
- Quantify the transformation value in Layer 5
- Let investment discussion happen in context of value

**Pattern:** "This problem costs you $X. The transformation delivers $Y. The investment is $Z."

### Positioning Anchoring

Present the highest-value framing first.

**Application:**
- Lead with the most valuable aspect of your offer
- Compare against higher-cost alternatives
- Frame as investment, not cost

### Packaging

When options exist, structure them to guide the decision.

**Application:**
- Three options: too small, just right, premium
- Make the target option most attractive
- Each tier should feel complete at its level

## Ethical Boundaries

Psychology triggers must serve alignment, not manipulation.

**Acceptable:**
- Helping readers recognize genuine value
- Overcoming unwarranted hesitation
- Creating urgency around real constraints
- Framing benefits in motivating ways

**Unacceptable:**
- Fabricating scarcity or social proof
- Exploiting fear or anxiety
- Hiding material information
- Pressure that overrides genuine objections

**Test:** Would the reader thank you for this persuasion if they understood what you were doing? If yes, proceed. If no, reconsider.
