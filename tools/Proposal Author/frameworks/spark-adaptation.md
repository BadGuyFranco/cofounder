# SPARK Adaptation for Proposals

How to apply SPARK principles at proposal transitions to maintain reader engagement through cognitive layers.

**Source of truth for SPARK:** `/cofounder/tools/Content Author/content types/spark.md`

Load the SPARK source file for core mechanics (Specificity, Recognition, Incompleteness) and emotional drivers (Frustration, Ambition, Curiosity, Recognition, Disgust). This file covers only the proposal-specific adaptation.

## SPARK in Proposals

SPARK was designed for headlines and opening hooks. In proposals, SPARK principles apply at every layer transition to prevent reader drop-off and maintain forward momentum.

**Proposal adaptation:** Each cognitive layer transition uses the three SPARK forces to pull the reader into the next layer. The proposal never lets the reader feel "done" until the final offer.

## Applying the Three Forces at Transitions

### Specificity at Transitions

Abstract statements let readers skim without absorbing. Concrete details demand attention.

**Application by layer:**
- Layer 1: Specific symptoms of the problem
- Layer 2: Specific details of their situation
- Layer 4: Specific results and metrics
- Layer 5: Specific details of their transformed future

**Weak:** "Companies struggle with inefficiency."
**Strong:** "Your team spends 14 hours a week in status meetings that could be a dashboard."

### Recognition at Transitions

The reader should think "YES, that's exactly it" rather than "that's interesting."

**Application by layer:**
- Layer 1: Name the felt experience of the problem
- Layer 2: Name their specific frustrations
- Layer 3: Name why other approaches have disappointed
- Layer 5: Name the feeling of having this solved

**Weak:** "Decision-making can be slow."
**Strong:** "You've sat in meetings where everyone agrees something needs to change, and then nothing happens."

### Incompleteness at Transitions

Open loops pull readers forward. Closed statements let them stop reading.

**Application by layer:**
- Layer 1 → 2: "The problem is clear. The question is whether anyone understands YOUR specific situation."
- Layer 2 → 3: "Understanding isn't enough. The question is what to do differently."
- Layer 3 → 4: "A different approach means nothing without evidence."
- Layer 4 → 5: "Proof that it works for others. But what does it mean for you?"
- Layer 5 → 6: "That future is possible. Here's how to get there."

**Weak transition:** "That's why we developed our solution."
**Strong transition:** "The question isn't whether this matters. It's why every attempt to fix it has failed."

## Emotional Drivers by Layer

Match emotional drivers to layer objectives. See SPARK source file for driver definitions.

| Layer | Objective | Primary Driver | Secondary Driver |
|-------|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| 1. Shared Reality | Establish problem | Recognition | Frustration |
| 2. Specific Understanding | Prove you get them | Specificity | Recognition |
| 3. Unique Perspective | Shift the frame | Frustration or Disgust | Curiosity |
| 4. Proof | Build belief | Curiosity | Ambition |
| 5. Future Vision | Create desire | Ambition | Recognition |
| 6. Natural Offer | Drive action | Resolution | Ambition |

**Resolution** (proposal-specific driver): The release of tension built through the proposal. The offer as relief. Used only in Layer 6.

## Transition Construction

### Layer 1 to Layer 2

**Goal:** Move from general problem to specific situation.
**Force emphasis:** Recognition → Specificity
**Pattern:** "This is the reality. But the question is whether [your situation] has been truly understood."

### Layer 2 to Layer 3

**Goal:** Move from understanding to new perspective.
**Force emphasis:** Specificity → Frustration/Curiosity
**Pattern:** "You've tried. Others have tried. The question is: why does this keep happening?"

### Layer 3 to Layer 4

**Goal:** Move from perspective to proof.
**Force emphasis:** Curiosity → Specificity
**Pattern:** "A different approach means nothing without evidence. Here's what happens when this actually gets applied."

### Layer 4 to Layer 5

**Goal:** Move from proof to personal vision.
**Force emphasis:** Curiosity → Ambition
**Pattern:** "It works. The question is: what does this mean for you?"

### Layer 5 to Layer 6

**Goal:** Move from vision to action.
**Force emphasis:** Ambition → Resolution
**Pattern:** "That future is available. Here's the path."

## Quality Checks for Transitions

For each layer transition, verify:

- [ ] **Specificity present:** At least one concrete detail, number, or image
- [ ] **Recognition attempted:** Names a felt experience, not just a situation
- [ ] **Incompleteness created:** Reader cannot stop here satisfied (until Layer 6)
- [ ] **Emotional driver matched:** Driver aligns with layer objective
- [ ] **Forward pull:** Reader wants to know what comes next

## Common Transition Failures

| Failure | Example | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Closed loop | "That's why we're the best choice." | Add question or tension before claim |
| Missing specificity | "Companies like yours..." | Name their specific situation |
| Flat emotion | "The next step is..." | Add recognition or ambition driver |
| Abrupt shift | "Now let's talk about pricing." | Bridge with relevance to reader |
| Generic pull | "Read on to learn more." | Create specific curiosity |
