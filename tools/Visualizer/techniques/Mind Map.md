# Mind Map

Visualizes ideas radiating from a single central concept, showing associative relationships and hierarchical branching.

## Cognitive Purpose

Activates spreading activation in semantic networks. Viewers explore ideas that branch from a central theme, see categories emerge naturally, and find unexpected connections through spatial proximity.

## When to Use

**Structure signals:**
- One central concept dominates
- Ideas branch outward into categories
- Exploration and ideation are goals
- Relationships are associative (grouped together) not explicit (labeled connections)

**Best for:**
- Brainstorming and idea generation
- Learning new domains
- Note-taking that preserves relationships
- Organizing thoughts around a central theme
- Personal knowledge exploration

**Not for:**
- Multiple central concepts (use Concept Map)
- Explicit labeled relationships (use Concept Map)
- Sequential processes (use Flow)
- Formal hierarchies with many levels (use Hierarchy)

## Layout Principles

**Radial structure (essential):**
- Central concept in the middle
- Main branches radiate outward
- Sub-branches extend from main branches
- Organic, non-linear arrangement

**Why radial matters:**
- Prevents artificial linearity of outlines
- Each branch can grow independently
- Spatial proximity shows conceptual relatedness
- No implied sequence (unlike top-down)

**Branch organization:**
- Main branches = major categories (5-7 maximum)
- Sub-branches = ideas within categories
- Use curves, not straight lines (organic feel)
- Space between branches for clarity

**Visual encoding:**
- Branch color = category
- Branch thickness = importance (thicker = more central)
- Text size = level (larger = more general)
- Images/icons can enhance memorability

## Required Labels

**Every branch needs a label:** Brief keyword or phrase

**Central concept:** Clear, prominent, defines the scope

**Labels should be:**
- Concise (1-3 words ideal)
- Keywords, not sentences
- Evocative (trigger recall)

## Complexity Management

**Threshold:** 5-7 main branches, 3-5 sub-branches each

**Above threshold:**
- Collapse sub-branches by default
- Click to expand
- Use "..." or count to indicate hidden content
- Consider splitting into linked mind maps

**Progressive disclosure:**
- Level 1: Central concept + main branches
- Level 2: Sub-branches on click/hover
- Level 3: Details in tooltips

## Interactivity (HTML)

**Required:**
- Click branch to expand/collapse sub-branches
- Hover for full text when labels are abbreviated
- Central concept always visible

**Recommended:**
- Zoom in/out (radial zoom from center)
- Drag to pan around large maps
- Focus mode: Click branch to center and expand it
- Add notes/details without cluttering main view

## Common Mistakes

**Linear layout:** Arranging branches top-to-bottom or left-to-right defeats the purpose. Use radial.

**Too many main branches:** More than 7 main branches creates chaos. Group into higher-level categories.

**Full sentences as labels:** Mind maps use keywords, not prose. Keep labels brief.

**Trying to show explicit relationships:** Mind maps show association through proximity, not labeled connections. If you need "causes" or "leads to" labels, use Concept Map instead.

**No visual hierarchy:** All branches looking the same makes structure unclear. Use size, color, and thickness to differentiate levels.

## Example Structure

```
                    [Sub 1a]
                   /
        [Branch 1]─────[Sub 1b]
       /          \
      /            [Sub 1c]
     /
    /     [Sub 2a]
───[CENTRAL]─────[Branch 2]─────[Sub 2b]
    \
     \
      \           [Sub 3a]
       \         /
        [Branch 3]─────[Sub 3b]
                 \
                  [Sub 3c]
```

Visual encoding:
- Center: Largest, bold, distinctive
- Main branches: Medium, colored by category
- Sub-branches: Smaller, same color as parent
- Curves: Organic, radial arrangement
- Keywords: Brief, evocative labels
