# Visualizer

Transform complex texts and ideas into beautiful, insightful visual representations.

## How It Works

1. Content is analyzed using the Categorize Content process to understand structure
2. Structure type determines which visualization technique to use
3. The appropriate tool renders the final output

## Techniques

| Technique | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| Concept Map | Networked relationships between multiple concepts |
| Hierarchy | Parent-child relationships, levels of abstraction |
| Flow | Sequential processes, decision logic |
| Matrix | Comparisons across two dimensions |
| Mind Map | Ideas radiating from a single central concept |
| Fishbone | Root cause analysis, contributing factors |
| Timeline | Events and phases over time |

## Tools

| Tool | When to Use |
|------|-------------|
| HTML | Primary tool. Full interactivity, all techniques. |
| Mermaid | Quick, simple diagrams. Embeds in markdown. |
