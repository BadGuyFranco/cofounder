# Content Author

A content writing system that produces authentic, practitioner-quality content. Built on testable enforcement mechanisms, not vague guidelines.

## Overview

Content Author uses two files together:
- **AGENTS.md** defines what makes good writing (universal craft rules)
- **voice.md** defines how a specific voice sounds (patterns and examples)

Your personal voice lives at `/memory/voice.md`. Optionally, root folders can have their own voice.md for specific brands, clients, or personas.

## Setup

If you don't have a voice.md yet, ask to set up your voice profile. This walks through a discovery process to capture your writing patterns.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| AGENTS.md | Craft rules, enforcement mechanisms |
| VoiceSetup.md | Voice profile creation process |
| content types/ | Format-specific workflows (blog, linkedin, x-posts, etc.) |
| utilities/ | Concept development, content review |

## Formats Available

blog-post, linkedin, x-posts, long-form, cold-email, script, speaking-notes, social-media

See `content types/template-format.md` for creating new formats.
