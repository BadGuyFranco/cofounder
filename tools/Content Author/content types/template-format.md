# Format: [Format Name]

## Purpose & Scope

[What this format is for - be specific about use cases and contexts]

## Target Specifications

**Length:** [Word count range or character limit]
**Platform:** [Where this will be published/delivered]
**Audience context:** [How/where readers encounter this content]
**Success metric:** [What makes this format successful]

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- [Key structural elements this format must have]
- [Structural elements this format must NOT have]

**Voice application notes:**
- [How voice.md principles apply specifically to this format]
- [Any voice adaptations needed for platform/length]
- Reference voice.md for pattern guidance (study structure, never copy phrases)

**Formatting standards:**
- [Headers, bullets, whitespace requirements]
- [Platform-specific formatting considerations]

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Scope

[Any upfront questions or decisions needed before starting]

Determine:
- [Key decision 1 for this format]
- [Key decision 2 for this format]
- Opening approach (if format uses hooks):
  - If using SPARK: Load content types/spark.md for complete framework
  - If skipping SPARK: Define format-appropriate alternative

### Step 1: [Step Name]

**Purpose:** [What this step accomplishes]

**Execute:**
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]
- [Reference to AGENTS.md enforcement mechanisms if applicable]
- [If this step writes opening/hook: Reference content types/spark.md if using SPARK Framework]

**Apply from voice.md:**
- [Relevant voice principles for this step]

**Apply from content types/spark.md (if opening/hook step):**
- [Relevant SPARK elements: emotional drivers, construction rules, quality checks]

**Output:** [What this step produces]

### Step 2: [Step Name]

**Purpose:** [What this step accomplishes]

**Execute:**
- [Specific action 1]
- [Specific action 2]

**Apply from voice.md:**
- [Relevant voice principles for this step]

**Output:** [What this step produces]

[Continue for all steps in workflow]

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (every sentence earns the next)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every sentence justified)
- [ ] No prohibited elements present
- [ ] Voice patterns match (compare against voice.md, not phrases)
- [ ] No repetition of non-common words 3+ times

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] [Format-specific quality criterion 1]
- [ ] [Format-specific quality criterion 2]
- [ ] [Format-specific quality criterion 3]

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- [Platform best practices]
- [Format conventions to follow]

**Don't:**
- [Platform anti-patterns to avoid]
- [Format mistakes to prevent]
