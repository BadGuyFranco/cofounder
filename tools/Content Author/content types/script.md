# Format: Script

## Purpose & Scope

Written scripts for video content, podcasts, voice-over, or recorded presentations. Content designed for spoken delivery that will be recorded and edited—optimized for narrative flow and conversational authenticity.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** Varies by medium (1 minute video = 150 words, 30-minute podcast = 4,500 words)
**Platform:** YouTube, podcast, course video, social video, recorded presentation
**Audience context:** Watching/listening on-demand, can pause/rewind but often don't
**Success metric:** Watch/listen completion, retention, action taken

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Written for spoken delivery (conversational, not literary)
- Scene/segment breaks with timing notes
- Visual or audio cues if applicable
- Natural speech patterns (contractions, fragments, incomplete thoughts)
- Explicit transitions between ideas
- Scripted but sounds unscripted

**Voice application notes:**
- Voice.md principles apply through spoken lens
- Builder's stance critical (sounds like real person, not narrator)
- Conversational patterns (how people actually talk)
- Can use more repetition than written (helps comprehension)
- Rhythm matters enormously (read aloud test essential)

**Formatting standards:**
- Actual spoken words only (no parenthetical stage directions mid-sentence)
- [Visual cue] or [Audio cue] on separate lines
- [Beat] or [Pause] markers for timing
- Scene/segment headers with time codes
- Estimated word count per segment

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Medium

Determine:
- Video or audio only?
- Target length (1 min, 5 min, 15 min, 30 min+)?
- Style (talking head, voice-over, interview, narrative)?
- Visuals involved (slides, screen share, B-roll)?
- Editing approach (tight cuts or natural flow)?

### Step 1: Structure and Beats

**Purpose:** Build narrative arc with clear segments

**Execute:**
- Identify single core message (what viewers remember after watching)
- Map major segments:
  - Hook/intro: 5-10% of runtime (faster for short videos)
  - Setup/context: 10-20% of runtime
  - Main content: 60-70% of runtime
  - Closing/action: 10-15% of runtime
- Within main content, identify 3-7 story beats
- Mark transition moments between segments
- Note visual/audio elements that support each segment
- Calculate word count targets:
  - Video: ~150 words per minute (conversational pace)
  - Podcast: ~130 words per minute (allows for more natural pauses)
  - Adjust for your actual speaking pace

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Results focus (every segment advances the point)
- Narrative arc (story structure, not list structure)

**Output:** Segment outline with timing, beats, and word count targets

### Step 2: Full Script Draft

**Purpose:** Write complete script optimized for spoken delivery

**Execute:**
- Hook/Intro [5-10% of runtime]:
  - Open with SPARK (see content types/spark.md if using hook)
  - Or open mid-action/mid-story
  - Establish who you are and why this matters (15-20 seconds max)
  - Make clear promise about what they'll get
  - [Beat]

- Main Content [60-70% of runtime]:
  - For each segment:
    - [Segment header with time code]
    - Transition line ("So here's what I learned...", "Let me show you...")
    - Core point developed through example or story
    - Why it matters (explicit connection)
    - Natural transition to next beat
  - Write actual spoken words:
    - Use contractions (you're, it's, don't)
    - Use fragments when natural ("Here's the thing.")
    - Use filler words sparingly but strategically (can add authenticity)
    - Vary sentence length dramatically
    - Mark [Pause] or [Beat] where silence does work
  - Note visual moments: [Show screen], [Cut to example], [B-roll: workshop footage]
  - Apply Bridge Check (spoken thoughts must connect)
  - Apply Deletion Check (but allow for natural spoken redundancy)

- Closing [10-15% of runtime]:
  - Callback to opening (if applicable)
  - Clear action or next step
  - Strong final line (no trailing off)

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance (sounds like real person sharing experience)
- Honest confidence (conversational confidence, not performance)
- In-the-room presence (like you're talking to one person)

**Output:** Complete script with segment markers and visual/audio cues

### Step 3: Read-Aloud Revision

**Purpose:** Ensure script sounds natural when spoken

**Execute:**
- Record yourself reading the script
- Listen back and mark:
  - Words/phrases that feel unnatural
  - Sentences too long to deliver in one breath
  - Transitions that sound forced
  - Pace issues (too fast, too slow)
  - Places where pause is needed but not marked
- Revise for speakability:
  - Replace written phrases with how you'd actually say it
  - Break long sentences into shorter ones
  - Add [Pause] markers where needed
  - Remove words that trip your tongue
  - Adjust timing if segments run long/short
- Test again until it flows naturally

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Rhythm and flow (spoken rhythm is everything)
- Honor simplicity (cut anything that makes delivery awkward)

**Output:** Final script that sounds natural when spoken

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (thoughts connect naturally)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every line justified)
- [ ] No prohibited elements (especially corporate jargon—sounds worse spoken)
- [ ] Authenticity constraints honored

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Hook works in first 15-30 seconds
- [ ] Script sounds natural when read aloud
- [ ] Word count matches target length
- [ ] Segment timing adds up correctly
- [ ] Visual/audio cues are clear
- [ ] Transitions sound conversational
- [ ] Closing lands clearly
- [ ] No tongue twisters or awkward phrases
- [ ] Sounds like you, not a "video voice"

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Write how you actually talk (contractions, fragments, natural patterns)
- Hook in first 15-30 seconds (retention drops fast)
- Use pauses strategically (silence is powerful on recording)
- Mark visual moments (screen, B-roll, cut points)
- Test by reading aloud (multiple times)
- Write strong opening and closing lines exactly
- Allow natural redundancy (helps comprehension in audio)

**Don't:**
- Write literary prose (sounds unnatural spoken)
- Pack too much info per minute (listeners need processing time)
- Use complex sentences (hard to deliver, hard to follow)
- Skip read-aloud testing (written ≠ spoken)
- Write "YouTube voice" or "podcast voice" (be yourself)
- Hide the payoff until the end (reward early viewers)
- Script every breath and pause (over-directing kills natural delivery)

## Common Failure Modes

**Written voice:** Script reads well but sounds unnatural when spoken. Test: Record yourself reading it. If it sounds like you're reading, rewrite how you'd actually say it.

**Info dumping:** Packing too much content per minute because you CAN edit. Viewers still need processing time. Aim for 130-150 words per minute, not 200.

**Weak hook:** Spending first 30 seconds on intro music, subscribe prompts, or slow build. Hook in first 15-30 seconds or lose 40%+ of viewers.

**Visual/script mismatch:** Script references visuals that aren't cued, or visuals shown without script mention. Sync them explicitly with [Visual: description] markers.

**Unnatural transitions:** Written transitions ("Furthermore", "Additionally") that sound weird spoken. Use conversational bridges: "So here's the thing...", "Now check this out..."

**Length optimism:** Scripting 5 minutes of content that actually runs 8 minutes when spoken naturally. Test your actual speaking pace and adjust word count targets.

**Performance voice:** Writing in "YouTube voice" or "podcast voice" rather than your actual voice. Sounds inauthentic. Viewers can tell.

**Monotonous pace:** Every sentence same length and rhythm. Vary dramatically. Short for punch. Longer for development. Fragment for emphasis.
