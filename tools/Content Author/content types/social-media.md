# Format: Social Media (Twitter/X)

## Purpose & Scope

Short-form posts for Twitter/X that share insights, observations, or provocations. Content that stops scrolling through compressed clarity or unexpected angles.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** 40-280 characters (optimal 120-200)
**Platform:** Twitter/X feed
**Audience context:** Fast scrollers deciding in 0.5 seconds whether to stop
**Success metric:** Engagement (likes, retweets, replies), profile visits, thread read-through

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Single tweet OR thread (connected tweets developing one idea)
- Must hook in first 5-7 words
- Can be standalone insight, observation, or thread opener
- Conversational but not casual—practitioner voice compressed
- Thread structure: Hook tweet → Development → Payoff

**Voice application notes:**
- Voice.md principles apply in ultra-compressed form
- Builder's stance even more critical (no room for posturing)
- Honest confidence works well (definitive takes, clear boundaries)
- No hedging (character limit makes it obvious)
- Rhythm matters—read aloud test essential

**Formatting standards:**
- Single thought per tweet
- Threads: Each tweet must stand alone AND connect to thread
- Line breaks for emphasis (sparingly)
- No emoji unless natural to your voice
- No hashtag stuffing

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Format

Determine:
- Single tweet or thread?
- Tone: Insight, observation, provocation, or teaching?
- Target: Cold audience (viral) or followers (depth)?

### Combined Step: Draft and Refine

**Purpose:** Create compressed, high-signal content

**Execute for single tweet:**
- Identify the single insight (one thing readers should think/do)
- Write first draft (don't worry about length yet)
- Apply Bridge Check (if multi-sentence, they must connect)
- Apply Deletion Check (ruthless—every word must justify itself)
- Cut to 280 characters or less
- Read aloud—does it land cleanly?
- Test: Would you stop scrolling for this? If no, rewrite

**Execute for thread:**
- Identify core insight (thread's destination)
- Map 3-7 tweets developing the idea
- Write hook tweet (must work standalone and invite "read more")
- Write thread tweets:
  - Each tweet stands alone
  - Each tweet connects causally to previous
  - Each tweet earns the next
  - Apply Bridge Check between tweets
  - Apply Deletion Check within tweets
- Write payoff tweet (lands the insight, invites engagement)
- Read entire thread aloud—does flow work?
- Test hook: Would you click "show this thread" based on first tweet?

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance (no BS, no posturing)
- Honest confidence (definitive takes with clear scope)
- Results focus (every word earns its place)
- Honor simplicity (compression reveals what matters)

**Apply from content types/spark.md (optional):**
- SPARK works well for hook tweets
- Specificity + tension + incompleteness in 120 characters
- Emotional drivers: Curiosity, wrath, greed work particularly well

**Output:** Final tweet or thread ready to post

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (thoughts connect causally)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every word justified)
- [ ] No prohibited elements (no hedging, jargon, throat-clearing)
- [ ] Authenticity constraints honored (no fabricated examples)

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Hook works in first 5-7 words
- [ ] Sounds like human practitioner (not "Twitter voice")
- [ ] Read aloud test passes (lands cleanly spoken)
- [ ] Single clear insight (not multiple competing ideas)
- [ ] Would make YOU stop scrolling (honest test)
- [ ] No emoji unless natural to voice
- [ ] No engagement bait ("Agree?" "RT if...")
- [ ] Thread: Each tweet works standalone AND in sequence

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Hook fast (first 5-7 words critical)
- Make definitive calls (no room for hedging)
- Show your work briefly (transparency builds trust)
- Use specifics (concrete beats abstract at 280 characters)
- End threads with clear takeaway or provocative question
- Sound like yourself (compression reveals authentic voice)

**Don't:**
- Use Twitter performance voice ("Here's the thing:", "Let that sink in", "This.")
- Write engagement bait ("Agree?", "Unpopular opinion:", "No one talks about this:")
- Thread for the sake of threading (if it's one tweet, it's one tweet)
- Hide the insight until tweet 8 of 10
- Use generic "wisdom" that could apply to anything
- Add obvious setup tweets to pad thread length
- Use line breaks for artificial drama

## Common Failure Modes

**Performance voice:** Writing in recognizable "Twitter voice" rather than your voice. Test: Remove your name—could this be anyone? If yes, it's generic.

**Buried insight:** Hook tweet that says nothing, forcing readers to gamble on thread value. Hook must work standalone and earn the click.

**Thread padding:** Stretching 2 tweets of insight into 8 tweets of thread. Compression is the format's superpower—don't fight it.

**Engagement bait:** "Agree?", "Thoughts?", "Let that sink in." Readers see through it. Strong content gets engagement without tricks.

**Hedging at scale:** "I think maybe this could be..." No room for hedging at 280 characters. Make the call or don't post.

**Generic wisdom:** "Build in public. Ship fast. Learn constantly." Could apply to anyone doing anything. Practitioner voice requires specificity.

**Format fighting:** Trying to fit long-form complexity into tweets. Twitter rewards compressed clarity, not complexity. If it needs 2,000 words, write a blog post and share a summary tweet.
