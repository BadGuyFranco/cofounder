# Format: Blog Post

## Purpose & Scope

Web-published content for brand blogs, company sites, or personal platforms. Content that balances accessibility with depth, optimized for web reading and SEO while maintaining practitioner voice.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** 800-2,000 words (optimal 1,200-1,500)
**Platform:** Brand blogs, company websites, Medium, Substack
**Audience context:** Readers who clicked through from search, social, or email
**Success metric:** Read completion, shares, backlinks, organic discovery

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Must hook in first 2-3 sentences (readers decide fast on web)
- Scannable structure with descriptive headers
- Can use visual elements (would be added separately)
- Internal and external links expected
- SEO considerations without compromising voice

**Voice application notes:**
- Full voice.md principles apply
- Web readers skim first, read second—make scanning valuable
- Headers and opening sentences do heavy lifting
- Practitioner credibility still essential but web-friendly
- Shorter paragraphs than long-form (2-3 sentences typical)

**Formatting standards:**
- Descriptive H2/H3 headers that work standalone
- Bulleted or numbered lists for scannable points
- Bold for key terms only
- No walls of text—break every 3-4 paragraphs
- First paragraph after header should establish section value

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Scope

Determine:
- Target keyword/topic (if SEO matters for this piece)
- Target length (800, 1200, 1500, 2000 words)?
- Opening approach (SPARK-driven hook or SEO-optimized intro)?
  - If using SPARK: Load content types/spark.md for complete framework
  - If SEO-focused: Lead with clear value proposition for search intent
- Link strategy (internal links to own content, external links to sources)?

### Step 1: Concept and Structure

**Purpose:** Define topic angle and scannable structure

**Execute:**
- Identify core insight or teaching (the one thing readers leave with)
- Test novelty: Is this angle fresh or just SEO rehash?
- Map 4-7 major sections with descriptive headers
- Write one-sentence purpose for each section
- Identify 2-3 places for concrete examples or data
- Note where internal/external links would add value

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance (practical, not theoretical)
- Honest confidence (own your boundaries)

**Output:** Section outline with descriptive headers + one-sentence purposes + link notes

### Step 2: Full Draft

**Purpose:** Write complete first draft optimized for web scanning

**Execute:**
- Write LONGER than target (you'll cut in step 3)
  - 800-word target → write to 1,100
  - 1,200-word target → write to 1,600
  - 1,500-word target → write to 2,000
- Open with SPARK (see content types/spark.md) or clear value statement
- Write each section:
  - Section header (descriptive, valuable standalone)
  - Opening sentence establishes section value
  - 2-3 paragraphs developing the point
  - Concrete examples or data points
  - Clear transition to next section
- Apply Bridge Check AS YOU WRITE
- Apply Deletion Check AS YOU WRITE
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)
- End with clear next step or takeaway

**Apply from voice.md:**
- All core principles (builder's stance, honest confidence, results focus)
- All signature moves (transparent certainty, rhythm and flow)
- Zero prohibited elements

**Output:** Complete first draft (longer than target, web-scannable structure)

### Step 3: Edit and Optimize

**Purpose:** Cut to length, optimize scannability, ensure quality

**Execute:**
- Run all preflight checks (from AGENTS.md):
  - Clean prose
  - Grounded claims
  - Natural flow
  - Fresh execution
  - Voice consistency
  - Human voice
- Cut back to target length
- Scan-test: Read only headers and opening sentences—do they tell coherent story?
- Check paragraph length (mostly 2-3 sentences)
- Verify concrete examples ground abstract claims
- Add [internal link notes] and [external source notes] where valuable
- Ensure transitions work for both readers and skimmers

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Honor simplicity (don't over-engineer what's already clear)
- Rules are defaults, not chains (break when it strengthens the work)

**Output:** Refined draft at target length, optimized for web reading

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (sentences connect causally)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every sentence justified)
- [ ] No prohibited elements present
- [ ] Authenticity constraints honored

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Opening hooks reader in first 2-3 sentences
- [ ] Headers are descriptive and valuable standalone
- [ ] Scan-test passes (headers + opening sentences tell story)
- [ ] Paragraphs mostly 2-3 sentences (web-friendly)
- [ ] Concrete examples ground main points
- [ ] Clear next step or takeaway at end
- [ ] Sounds like human practitioner, not content marketing
- [ ] Length appropriate (800-2,000 words)

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Front-load value (readers bail fast on web)
- Make scanning rewarding (headers, opening sentences, bold terms)
- Use shorter paragraphs than print (screen reading is different)
- Ground claims in experience or data
- Link to sources and related content naturally
- End with clear action or insight

**Don't:**
- Write SEO-first at expense of voice (Google rewards good writing now)
- Use clickbait hooks that don't deliver
- Create walls of text without breaks
- Hide the value until halfway through
- Write in "blog voice" (overly casual, first-person everything)
- Stuff keywords unnaturally
- Add fluff to hit word count

## Common Failure Modes

**SEO zombie writing:** Hitting keywords and length targets while saying nothing. Test: Would a practitioner share this? If no, it's SEO spam disguised as content.

**Buried lede:** Taking 3 paragraphs to get to the point. Web readers won't wait. Hook fast, deliver value, then develop.

**Unscannable walls:** Long paragraphs, vague headers, no clear structure. Test: Can someone scan this in 30 seconds and get value? If no, add structure.

**Generic advice:** "10 tips for better X" with obvious points. Test: Could this exact post exist on 50 other sites? If yes, find the specific angle or don't publish.

**Voice drift:** Starting with practitioner voice, sliding into marketing speak by paragraph 5. Voice.md principles apply to every paragraph, not just the opening.

**Length padding:** Hitting 1,500 words by repeating points or adding obvious elaboration. If it's done at 900 words, it's done. Artificial length kills credibility.
