# Format: Speaking Notes

## Purpose & Scope

Notes for live presentations, talks, workshops, or recorded video content. Content designed to be spoken, not read—optimized for delivery, not publication.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** Varies by talk length (5-minute talk = 1 page, 45-minute talk = 5-8 pages)
**Platform:** Live stage, video recording, workshop, webinar
**Audience context:** Listening in real-time, cannot rewind or reread
**Success metric:** Audience understanding, engagement, action taken post-talk

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Conversational markers (not polished prose)
- Clear section breaks with timing notes
- Explicit transitions between ideas
- Space for audience interaction (pauses, questions, examples)
- Visual/demo cues if slides or props involved

**Voice application notes:**
- Voice.md principles apply but optimized for spoken delivery
- Builder's stance essential (you're in the room with them)
- Even more conversational than written content
- Repetition is helpful (listeners can't reread)
- Signposting is critical ("Here's why this matters", "Three things", "The key point")

**Formatting standards:**
- Bullet points, not paragraphs
- Bold for emphasis points
- [Timing notes] in brackets
- [Transition markers] explicit
- [Pause] indicators where silence matters
- Short phrases, not full sentences (unless it's a critical quote/line)

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Context

Determine:
- Talk length and format (keynote, workshop, fireside chat)?
- Audience level (practitioners, beginners, mixed)?
- Delivery style (scripted, notes-based, improvisational)?
- Slides/demos/props involved?
- Interactive elements (Q&A, exercises, discussions)?

### Step 1: Structure and Timing

**Purpose:** Build talk arc with timing discipline

**Execute:**
- Identify single core message (what they remember 3 months later)
- Map major sections with time allocations:
  - Opening/hook: 5-10% of time
  - Context/setup: 10-15% of time
  - Main content: 60-70% of time
  - Closing/action: 10-15% of time
- Within main content, identify 3-5 major beats
- Mark transition points between sections
- Add [timing check] markers every 10-15 minutes
- Note where interaction happens (questions, exercises, pauses)

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Results focus (every minute leads somewhere)
- Honor simplicity (don't overpack—listeners need processing time)

**Output:** Timed structure outline with major sections and beats

### Step 2: Content Development

**Purpose:** Write speakable notes that guide delivery

**Execute:**
- Opening [5-10% of time]:
  - Hook (SPARK optional—see content types/spark.md if using)
  - Who you are, why you're credible (15 seconds max)
  - What they'll get (clear promise)
  - [Pause—let them settle]
- Main content [60-70% of time]:
  - For each major beat:
    - Transition in ("Now let's look at...", "Here's where it gets interesting")
    - Core point (written as bullet or short phrase)
    - Supporting detail/example (bullet points)
    - Why it matters (explicit connection to their world)
    - [Pause or interaction point]
  - Mark stories/examples with [STORY: brief descriptor]
  - Mark critical lines you want to deliver exactly as written
  - Add [Timing check: should be at XX:XX] every 10-15 minutes
- Closing [10-15% of time]:
  - Callback to opening
  - Clear action or invitation
  - No summary (they just heard it)
  - Strong final line (write this exactly as you'll say it)

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance (in-the-room presence)
- Honest confidence (transparent about scope and certainty)
- Co-solving invitation (collaborative language)

**Output:** Complete speaking notes with timing markers and delivery cues

### Step 3: Rehearsal Refinement

**Purpose:** Test timing, flow, and delivery

**Execute:**
- Do timed run-through (record yourself or practice live)
- Mark sections that ran long or felt rushed
- Identify awkward transitions
- Note where you need more or fewer notes
- Test story/example clarity (do they land when spoken?)
- Verify timing checks are accurate
- Adjust for actual delivery pace

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Rhythm and flow (spoken rhythm different from written)
- Read aloud check (literally read it aloud)

**Output:** Refined notes with accurate timing and delivery confidence

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (ideas connect causally)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every point justified)
- [ ] No prohibited elements (no jargon, hedging visible when spoken)
- [ ] Authenticity constraints honored

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Opening hooks in first 30-60 seconds
- [ ] Timing adds up to target length
- [ ] Transitions are explicit (listeners need signposting)
- [ ] Notes are speakable (not written prose)
- [ ] Stories/examples marked and ready
- [ ] Timing checks placed strategically
- [ ] Closing lands with clear action
- [ ] No slide-reading (if slides present)
- [ ] Rehearsal timing matched plan

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Write for ears, not eyes (shorter sentences, explicit transitions)
- Use repetition strategically (listeners can't rewind)
- Mark pauses (silence is powerful spoken)
- Signal what's important ("Here's the key", "Remember this")
- Include interaction points (questions, pauses, exercises)
- Write critical lines exactly as you'll say them
- Time yourself in rehearsal

**Don't:**
- Write full paragraphs (you'll read them poorly)
- Pack too much content (listeners need processing time)
- Hide transitions (be explicit: "Now let's shift to...")
- Skip timing markers (you'll run over without them)
- Write slide content (slides support, don't duplicate)
- Ad-lib critical points (write them exactly)
- Ignore audience energy level (mark energy shifts)

## Common Failure Modes

**Over-scripting:** Writing full prose paragraphs and trying to deliver them. Sounds like reading, not speaking. Bullets and phrases work better for natural delivery.

**Content overload:** Trying to cover everything in one talk. Listeners can absorb 3-5 major points max. More than that and nothing sticks.

**Slide reading:** Notes that duplicate slides word-for-word. Your notes guide what you SAY. Slides show what reinforces it. Different content.

**Timing optimism:** Planning content for 45 minutes that actually takes 60. Rehearse with timer. Cut ruthlessly. Running over destroys everything that came before.

**Buried transitions:** Jumping between ideas without explicit bridges. Listeners get lost. Use clear signposting: "Now let's look at...", "Here's the second piece...", "This leads us to..."

**Weak opening:** Taking 5 minutes to introduce yourself, thank organizers, and apologize. Hook fast. Establish credibility through content, not credentials.

**Summary closing:** Restating everything you just said. They heard it. End with action, invitation, or provocation. Strong final line.

**Missing pauses:** Wall-to-wall talking with no processing time. Mark [Pause] points. Silence lets ideas land.
