# Format: Cold Email Outreach

## Purpose & Scope

Cold email outreach to investors, potential customers, partners, advisors, or industry contacts. This format covers the complete outreach sequence: initial contact, follow-up, and final attempt. Each email in the sequence has distinct mechanics designed to move strangers through the trust-building process without triggering spam filters or recipient exhaustion.

## Target Specifications

**Length per email:**
- Initial email: 50-125 words
- Follow-up email: 75-150 words
- Final attempt: 50-100 words

**Platform:** Email (optimized for mobile inbox scanning)
**Audience context:** Busy professionals scanning 50-200 emails daily, 55% of which are spam
**Success metric:** Response rate (not just positive responses—any reply that moves the conversation forward)

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- **Subject line:** "Boring Subject Line Strategy" ([Name] - [Topic])
- **Body:** Four-line structure (Connection, Ask, Credibility, Question)
- **No attachments** on initial email
- **Mobile-optimized** (looks clean on phone screen)
- **Single focused ask** per email
- **Must end with question mark** (Open Loop psychology)

**Structural elements to avoid:**
- Apologies or hedging ("Sorry to bother you", "I know you're busy")
- Generic compliments ("I love your work")
- Industry chaos openers ("I know [industry] is challenging right now")
- Vague asks ("Let me know if you want to chat")
- Multiple asks in one email
- Ending with statements instead of questions
- **Emojis** (Data shows 25% reduction in professional response rates)

**Voice application notes:**
- Use third-person instructional framing (teaching a method)
- Builder's stance: peer-to-peer, not supplicant-to-authority
- Honest confidence: clear about value you offer, transparent about what you want
- No corporate jargon or sales-speak
- Results focus: every word earns its place

**Formatting standards:**
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- No bullet points in email body (bullets signal mass marketing)
- Clean line breaks between sections
- Subject line separate from body
- Signature block minimal (name, title, company only)

## Workflow

### Step 0: The Warm Up (Mandatory Pre-Requisite)

**"Cold" is a misnomer.** You should never send a completely cold email if you can avoid it.
- **Goal:** Become a "familiar digital entity" before your email lands.
- **Action:** Engage 1-2 times on their preferred platform (LinkedIn/Twitter) *before* sending.
- **Method:** Leave a thoughtful comment, share their post, or like their update.
- **Result:** When your email arrives, they think "Oh, that person from LinkedIn," not "Who is this spammer?"

### Pre-Work: Clarify Scope

Before writing, determine:
- **Recipient research**: What specific detail proves you know who they are?
- **Value proposition**: What will THEY gain from responding? (Not what you want from them)
- **Ask specificity**: What exact action do you want them to take?
- **Sequence strategy**: Are you prepared to send 2-3 emails over 2-3 weeks if they don't respond?

Opening approach:
- Cold email does NOT use SPARK Framework (too aggressive for inbox context)
- Instead: Use connection line + immediate value signal
- Focus on personalization and relevance over emotional activation

### Step 1: Write Subject Line

**Strategy: "The Boring Subject Line"**
**Purpose:** Look like administrative work or a colleague's note, NOT a marketing blast.

**Execute:**
- Format: [Their First Name] - [Specific Value/Topic]
- **Why it works:** "Boring" signals internal correspondence. "Exciting" signals spam.
- **Name:** Creates attention trigger (pattern interrupt).
- **Topic:** Must be specific enough that recipient knows if it's relevant.
- **Avoid:** Vague questions ("Quick question"), generic topics ("Collaboration opportunity"), emojis, all caps, excessive punctuation.
- **Test:** Could this subject line apply to 100 different recipients? If yes, make it more specific.

**Examples:**
- "Chris - Introduction to Sports Tech Startups"
- "Sarah - Question about your Series A"

**Output:** Subject line under 50 characters that signals "this is for YOU about THIS"

### Step 2: Write Email 1 (Initial Contact)

**Purpose:** Move from stranger to legitimate contact worth responding to

**Execute (The 4-Line Framework):**
- **Line 1 (Connection):** Specific compliment, mutual connection reference, or shared reality
  - Must prove you researched them specifically
  - Must be verifiable (reference specific work, episode, article, post)
  - Must connect to your ask
  - Example: "I really enjoyed your episode on founder-led sales and took away the framework about qualifying early leads"
  
- **Line 2 (Ask):** State what you want directly
  - No ambiguity
  - Clear call-out of your purpose
  - Example: "I'm reaching out because I'd like your advice on breaking into the Colorado startup scene"
  
- **Line 3 (Credibility):** Why should they listen to you?
  - Relevant background (not full resume)
  - Name-drop if you have it (companies, universities, mutual connections)
  - Keep it to one sentence
  - Example: "I've spent 15 years helping startups scale operations and worked with companies like X and Y"
  
- **Line 4 (Question Hook):** End with specific question
  - **Psychology:** Questions create "Open Loops" the brain wants to close. Statements do not.
  - **Data:** Ending with a question boosts response rates by ~20%.
  - Must be easy to say yes to.
  - Example: "Would you be open to a brief call?" or "Can I send you more information?"

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance: Write as peer, not supplicant
- Honest confidence: Clear about value you offer
- Transparent certainty: Show your basis (your experience, your research on them)
- No hedging: No "might," "perhaps," "maybe"

**Apply from AGENTS.md:**
- Bridge check: Each line must flow naturally to the next
- Deletion check: Every word must earn its place (especially critical in 50-125 word limit)
- No prohibited elements: No corporate jargon, no unnecessary qualifiers

**Output:** Email 1 body text (50-125 words) + subject line

### Step 3: Write Email 2 (Follow-Up)

**Purpose:** Re-engage without annoying; add new value or context

**Execute:**
- Reference Email 1 in opening line
- Add NEW information or value (don't just repeat yourself)
- Acknowledge they might have missed it (not that they ignored it)
- Restate ask with slight modification or additional context
- Keep question hook structure

Structure:
- **Line 1:** Reference first email ("Following up on my email from last week about X")
- **Line 2:** New value/context ("Since then, [new development/information/offer]")
- **Line 3:** Modified or clearer ask ("I'd love to [specific action] if you're working on [their interest]")
- **Line 4:** Question hook with easy exit ("Does this timing work, or should I try back in a few weeks?")

Timing: Send 7-10 days after Email 1 with no response

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Same voice as Email 1 (consistent persona)
- Confident but not pushy
- Acknowledge reality without apologizing ("You're probably slammed...")

**Output:** Email 2 body text (75-150 words) + subject line (often "Re: [Original Subject]")

### Step 4: Write Email 3 (Final Attempt)

**Purpose:** Last chance to engage; respect their non-response while leaving door open

**Execute:**
- Shortest of three emails (50-100 words)
- Acknowledge the silence without being passive-aggressive
- Make it easy to say no or defer
- Leave relationship intact for future
- Still end with question

Structure:
- **Line 1:** Acknowledge you've reached out before ("I've reached out a couple times about X")
- **Line 2:** Acknowledge they may not be interested ("I'm guessing the timing isn't right or this isn't a priority")
- **Line 3:** Offer graceful exit ("Should I take you off my list, or would you prefer I try back in [timeframe]?")
- **Line 4:** Leave door open ("Either way, [genuine well-wish about their work]")

Timing: Send 7-10 days after Email 2 with no response (14-20 days after Email 1)

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Respectful but not desperate
- Professional but human
- Give them permission to say no

**Output:** Email 3 body text (50-100 words) + subject line (often "Re: [Original Subject]")

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Warm the relationship first if possible (LinkedIn engagement, comment on their content)
- Send from personal email, not company generic address
- Use plain text or minimal HTML formatting
- Include working email signature with title and company
- Send during business hours in recipient's timezone
- Use recipient's first name in subject line
- Research before writing (spend 5-10 minutes per high-value recipient)
- Track opens/clicks if your tool allows (helps with timing)

**Don't:**
- Send attachments on first email (triggers spam filters)
- Use BCC to send to multiple people
- Include images or logos in body (increases spam score)
- Write from "no-reply" addresses
- Send on weekends or late night
- Use email marketing tools that make it look automated
- Copy-paste same email to 100 people
- Follow up more than twice (three total emails maximum)
- Get passive-aggressive in follow-ups
- Use emojis in professional cold email (25% response penalty)
- Start with "I hope this email finds you well" or similar throat-clearing

## Common Failure Modes

**The Apology Tour:** Opening with "Sorry to bother you" or "I know you're busy" signals that even you don't believe your message deserves attention. Delete all apologies. You're offering value, not begging for charity.

**The Narcissist's Manifesto:** Writing three paragraphs about your company, your vision, your journey before getting to what you want. They don't care about you yet—they care about what's in it for them. Lead with their benefit.

**The Industry Explainer:** "I know the healthcare industry is chaotic right now..." You don't know their reality. Telling a stranger about their own industry comes off as arrogant and presumptive.

**The Vague Ask:** "Let me know if you'd like to connect" or "Happy to chat sometime" puts all cognitive load on recipient. Be specific: "Would you be open to a 15-minute call next Tuesday at 2pm EST?"

**False Flattery:** "I love your work" followed by generic pitch proves you didn't actually research them. Either make compliments specific and verifiable, or skip them entirely.

**The Wall of Text:** Email looks like a novel on mobile screen. Keep it scannable. Short paragraphs. White space. Concise sentences.

**Template Syndrome:** Using obvious mail merge fields or generic language that could apply to anyone. Personalization isn't just inserting their name—it's proving you know who they are and why you're reaching out to them specifically.

**Premature Attachment Syndrome:** Including pitch deck, one-pager, or PDF on first email. This triggers spam filters and signals you're selling before establishing any relationship. Wait until they ask for materials.

**Follow-Up Fatigue:** Sending identical follow-up emails that just say "bumping this up" or "just checking in." Each follow-up must add new value or context, or you're just annoying them.

**The Guilt Trip:** Final email that says "I'm disappointed you didn't respond" or implies they owe you something. They don't. Make it easy for them to say no and move on professionally.
