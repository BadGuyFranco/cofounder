# Format: X Posts

## Purpose & Scope

Short-form posts for X (Twitter) that share insights, observations, or provocations. Content that stops scrolling through compressed clarity, unexpected angles, and visual reinforcement. Optimized for conversation-driving engagement.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** 
- Hook: Maximum 15 words (optimal 7 words)
- Full tweet: 71-100 characters for shareability; 141-280 characters for engagement
- Threads: 5-10 tweets (7 is optimal)

**Platform:** X feed

**Audience context:** Fast scrollers deciding in 0.5 seconds whether to stop; 18-24 minute content half-life means timing and early engagement are critical

**Success metric:** Replies and conversation (replies carry 75x algorithmic weight vs. likes at 0.5x)

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Single tweet OR thread (connected tweets developing one idea)
- Hook must work in first 7-15 words using SPARK Framework
- Visual content required unless insight is purely textual
- First comment strategy for any external links
- Thread structure: Hook tweet → Development (with visual breaks every 3-4 tweets) → Payoff

**Voice application notes:**
- Voice.md principles apply in ultra-compressed form
- Builder's stance even more critical (no room for posturing)
- Honest confidence works well (definitive takes, clear boundaries)
- No hedging (character limit makes it obvious)
- Rhythm matters—read aloud test essential

**Formatting standards:**
- Single thought per tweet
- Threads: Each tweet must stand alone AND connect to thread
- Line breaks for emphasis (sparingly)
- No emoji unless natural to your voice
- Never use hashtags (no longer relevant on X; they do not improve reach)

## Visual Content Strategy

**Default assumption:** Every X post should include visual content unless the insight is purely textual or conversational.

**Why:** Images increase engagement by 28.75x. Video delivers 10x engagement vs. text-only. Visual content is not optional enhancement—it's core to performance.

**Visual direction approach:**
- Do NOT write specific image descriptions
- DO provide thematic concept or metaphor to follow
- Include 2 example directions the image could take

**Example visual direction output:**

> **Visual direction:** Contrast between complexity and simplicity
> - Example 1: Tangled knot next to a clean, single line
> - Example 2: Cluttered desk vs. one focused tool

> **Visual direction:** The moment before breakthrough
> - Example 1: Seed just cracking through soil surface
> - Example 2: Dawn light hitting mountain peak while valley is still dark

**Video specifications (when applicable):**
- Optimal length: 15-45 seconds
- First 10 seconds are critical for retention
- Captions required (85% watch without sound)
- Videos under 15 seconds achieve 22% higher completion

## Link Strategy

**Core rule:** Never include external links in the main tweet. Links are algorithmically suppressed.

**First comment strategy:** When a tweet needs to link somewhere, draft both:
1. The main tweet (no link)
2. The first comment containing the link

**Output format:**

> **Tweet:**
> [Main content without link]
>
> **First comment:**
> [Brief context + link]

**Example:**

> **Tweet:**
> We rebuilt our onboarding flow from scratch. Activation jumped 34% in two weeks.
>
> **First comment:**
> Full breakdown of what we changed: [link]

## Timing Strategy

**Optimal posting windows:**
- Best days: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- Best times: 8-11 AM in audience's local time
- Single best time: Wednesday 9 AM
- Avoid: Weekends (40%+ lower engagement than weekdays)

**Frequency benchmarks:**
- Quality-focused: 4-5 tweets per week
- Aggressive growth: 5-10 tweets daily
- Engagement drops noticeably after 7+ posts per day

**Early engagement is critical:** 50% of total engagement arrives within 18-24 minutes. Respond to every comment in the first 30 minutes of posting.

## Workflow

### Pre-Work: Clarify Format

Determine:
- Single tweet or thread?
- Visual content needed? (default: yes)
- Link required? (prepare first comment)
- Tone: Insight, observation, provocation, or teaching?

### Combined Step: Draft and Refine

**Purpose:** Create compressed, high-signal content with visual direction

**Execute for single tweet:**
1. Identify the single insight (one thing readers should think/do)
2. Write hook using SPARK Framework (see content types/spark.md)
   - Maximum 15 words (optimal 7)
   - Must stop scrolling immediately
3. Write first draft (don't worry about length yet)
4. Apply Bridge Check (if multi-sentence, they must connect)
5. Apply Deletion Check (ruthless—every word must justify itself)
6. Cut to target length:
   - 71-100 characters if optimizing for shares
   - 141-280 characters if optimizing for engagement
7. Read aloud—does it land cleanly?
8. Draft visual direction (thematic concept + 2 example directions)
9. Draft first comment if link needed
10. Test: Would you stop scrolling for this? If no, rewrite

**Execute for thread:**
1. Identify core insight (thread's destination)
2. Map 5-10 tweets developing the idea (aim for 7)
3. Write hook tweet using SPARK Framework:
   - Maximum 15 words (optimal 7)
   - Must work standalone and invite "read more"
4. Write thread tweets:
   - Each tweet stands alone
   - Each tweet connects causally to previous
   - Each tweet earns the next
   - Apply Bridge Check between tweets
   - Apply Deletion Check within tweets
   - Add visual break every 3-4 tweets (increases completion by 45%)
5. Write payoff tweet (lands the insight, invites engagement)
6. Read entire thread aloud—does flow work?
7. Draft visual direction for hook tweet (thematic concept + 2 examples)
8. Draft first comment if link needed
9. Test hook: Would you click "show this thread" based on first tweet?

**Apply from voice.md:**
- Builder's stance (no BS, no posturing)
- Honest confidence (definitive takes with clear scope)
- Results focus (every word earns its place)
- Honor simplicity (compression reveals what matters)

**Apply from content types/spark.md:**
- SPARK Framework required for all hook tweets
- Specificity + tension + incompleteness in 7-15 words
- Emotional drivers from SPARK catalog (do not add additional emotional frameworks)

**Output:** Final tweet or thread with visual direction and first comment (if applicable)

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (from AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes (thoughts connect causally)
- [ ] Deletion check passes (every word justified)
- [ ] No prohibited elements (no hedging, jargon, throat-clearing)
- [ ] Authenticity constraints honored (no fabricated examples)

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Hook uses SPARK Framework (max 15 words, optimal 7)
- [ ] Visual direction provided (thematic + 2 examples) unless purely textual
- [ ] No hashtags (none, ever)
- [ ] No links in main tweet (first comment strategy used if link needed)
- [ ] Sounds like human practitioner (not "Twitter voice")
- [ ] Read aloud test passes (lands cleanly spoken)
- [ ] Single clear insight (not multiple competing ideas)
- [ ] Would make YOU stop scrolling (honest test)
- [ ] No emoji unless natural to voice
- [ ] No engagement bait ("Agree?" "RT if...")
- [ ] Thread: 5-10 tweets with visual breaks every 3-4

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Hook fast using SPARK (7-15 words)
- Include visual content by default
- Make definitive calls (no room for hedging)
- Show your work briefly (transparency builds trust)
- Use specifics (concrete beats abstract at 280 characters)
- Put links in first comment, never main tweet
- End threads with clear takeaway or provocative question
- Sound like yourself (compression reveals authentic voice)
- Post Tuesday-Thursday, 8-11 AM
- Respond to comments within first 30 minutes

**Don't:**
- Use hashtags (they no longer help on X)
- Include external links in main tweet
- Use Twitter performance voice ("Here's the thing:", "Let that sink in", "This.")
- Write engagement bait ("Agree?", "Unpopular opinion:", "No one talks about this:")
- Thread for the sake of threading (if it's one tweet, it's one tweet)
- Hide the insight until tweet 8 of 10
- Use generic "wisdom" that could apply to anything
- Add obvious setup tweets to pad thread length
- Use line breaks for artificial drama
- Skip visual content without good reason

## Common Failure Modes

**Missing visual direction:** Drafting text-only when an image would dramatically increase engagement. Default to including visual direction unless insight is purely conversational.

**Hashtag habit:** Adding hashtags out of old habit. Hashtags no longer improve reach on X. Remove them entirely.

**Link in main tweet:** Including URLs in the tweet body. Algorithm suppresses this. Always use first comment strategy.

**Performance voice:** Writing in recognizable "Twitter voice" rather than your voice. Test: Remove your name—could this be anyone? If yes, it's generic.

**Weak hook:** Hook that doesn't use SPARK, runs over 15 words, or buries the tension. The hook IS the tweet; everything else is development.

**Buried insight:** Hook tweet that says nothing, forcing readers to gamble on thread value. Hook must work standalone and earn the click.

**Thread padding:** Stretching 2 tweets of insight into 8 tweets of thread. Compression is the format's superpower—don't fight it.

**Engagement bait:** "Agree?", "Thoughts?", "Let that sink in." Readers see through it. Strong content gets engagement without tricks.

**Hedging at scale:** "I think maybe this could be..." No room for hedging at 280 characters. Make the call or don't post.

**Generic wisdom:** "Build in public. Ship fast. Learn constantly." Could apply to anyone doing anything. Practitioner voice requires specificity.

**Format fighting:** Trying to fit long-form complexity into tweets. X rewards compressed clarity, not complexity. If it needs 2,000 words, write a blog post and share a summary tweet with first comment link.

**Ignoring timing:** Posting at random times. Tuesday-Thursday mornings consistently outperform. Content half-life is brutal; timing matters.
