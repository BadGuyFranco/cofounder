# SPARK Framework: Headlines, Titles, and Opening Hooks

## What This Solves

Most content dies in the first three seconds. Readers scan the opening, find nothing that demands their attention, and bail. A SPARK earns the next sentence by activating emotion before logic.

## Core Mechanics

A SPARK combines three forces simultaneously:

**Specificity** - A concrete detail, number, or image that grounds the reader. Abstract openings let readers skim without absorbing.

**Recognition** - Name something the reader feels but hasn't articulated. The test: Would they think "YES, that's exactly how it feels"? If you've only described the situation without naming the felt experience, you've missed.

**Incompleteness** - An unresolved question or tension that demands continuation. The reader should lean in during the pause after your hook, hungry for what's next.

## Emotional Drivers

Select a driver that matches your reader's relationship to the topic:

**Frustration** - Something's broken and it's costing them. Waste, dysfunction, injustice they've experienced but couldn't name.

**Ambition** - There's an edge they're missing. What competitors know. Untapped opportunity. The gap between where they are and where they could be.

**Curiosity** - An information gap that demands closure. Something they should know but don't.

**Recognition** - Someone finally named what they've felt. Belonging, validation, hope that their instinct was right.

**Disgust** - Visceral reaction to hypocrisy, exploitation, or waste they've witnessed.

## Construction

1. Lead with concrete detail, never abstract concept
2. Start on the strongest word - no throat-clearing (see AGENTS.md Prohibited Patterns)
3. Keep syntax short and clean - complex clauses dilute impact
4. Sound like conversation starting, not a slogan or tagline
5. Create an open loop the body will resolve

## Quality Checks

Run these. If any fails, rewrite:

**Recognition check:** Would the reader think "YES, that's exactly it"? If not, you've described without naming the felt experience.

**Pull check:** Does the first line earn the second? Can they bail without consequence? If yes, it's not a SPARK.

**Uniqueness check:** Is this specific to THIS topic? If you could swap in another topic and it still works, it's generic.

**Subtext check:** Is emotion shown through situation, not named? "This frustrating situation..." kills the emotion. Show the situation that creates it.

## What Kills Hooks

- Generic openings that could apply to any topic
- Emotionally flat (technically correct but doesn't land)
- Sounds like a LinkedIn headline or marketing copy
- Clichés and overstuffed syntax (see AGENTS.md Prohibited Patterns)

## When NOT to Use

SPARK is for practitioner content where hooking attention matters. Skip for:
- Reference documentation (readers need context, not hooks)
- Academic writing (formal openings expected)
- Technical specifications (clarity over engagement)
