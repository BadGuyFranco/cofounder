# Format: LinkedIn Post

## Purpose & Scope

Professional thought leadership, insights, and perspective-sharing for practitioner audience on LinkedIn. Content that engages professional network through accessible depth and conversational professionalism.

## Target Specifications

**Length:** 800-1,200 characters optimal for standard posts; 1,800-2,100 characters for thought leadership pieces  
**Reading level:** 4th-grade maximum; above 10th-grade loses 35%+ reach  
**Sentence length:** 8-10 words maximum; 91% of LinkedIn engagement is mobile  
**Structure:** 16-20 sentences across ~10 paragraphs for optimal readability  
**Hook window:** First 120-150 characters appear before "see more" - this is your entire pitch  
**Platform:** LinkedIn feed  
**Audience context:** Scrolling professionals on mobile deciding whether to stop and read  
**Success metric:** Saves (5x algorithmic weight vs likes), thoughtful comments (10+ words count double), shares

## Format Selection

Choose format before writing. Format determines up to half your reach potential.

| Format | Reach Multiplier | Best For |
|--------|------------------|----------|
| Poll | 1.64-1.99x | Audience engagement, quick insights |
| Carousel/Document | 1.45-1.6x | Educational how-to content, frameworks |
| Multi-image | 1.18x reach, 6.60% engagement | Visual concepts, before/after |
| Video (native) | 1.10x | Demonstrations, personal connection |
| Text-only | 0.88x (penalty) | When other formats don't fit |

**Carousel specifications:**
- 12-13 slides optimal; under 5 slides reduces reach by 35%
- Vertical layout required; horizontal loses 35% reach
- Caption under 500 characters
- 25-50 words per slide; single-sentence slides lose 30%
- Educational content only; product presentations lose 60-70% reach

**Video specifications:**
- 30-60 seconds optimal; beyond 3 minutes loses 15% per additional minute
- Vertical format (9:16) gains 15% more reach
- Native upload only; YouTube links lose 50% reach

## Format-Specific Characteristics

**Structural requirements:**
- Hook must land in first 120-150 characters (the "see more" click itself signals engagement)
- Single core insight per post
- Personal or specific framing, not generic advice
- Natural paragraph breaks for mobile scanning

**Voice application:**
- Apply voice.md principles in compressed form
- Professional but conversational, not corporate
- Builder's stance critical: peer-to-peer, not lecture
- Must sound like actual human professional

**Formatting standards:**
- Natural paragraph breaks (2-4 sentences per paragraph)
- Short sentences under 12 words improve performance by 20%
- Strategic white space adds 25% engagement boost
- Bold only for key terms, sparingly
- No emoji unless natural to your authentic voice
- **No hashtags.** LinkedIn disabled hashtag pages in October 2024. Hashtags no longer impact reach. Using 6+ actively harms visibility; 10+ may trigger spam detection. Skip them entirely.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Select Format

Determine optimal format using Format Selection table above. Text-only carries an algorithmic penalty; use alternative formats when content allows.

### Step 2: Clarify Scope

Determine:
- Single insight or observation to share
- Source: original thinking, extracted from longer content, or response to trend?
- Tone: reflection, challenge, or teaching?

### Step 3: Develop Concept and Draft

**Identify the single insight** readers should walk away with.

**Find 1-2 specific details** to ground it:
- Concrete example (named, real)
- Unexpected detail (memorable)
- Contrarian angle (challenges conventional thinking)
- Number/data point (specific metric)
- Observable moment (what you saw/experienced)

Research shows personal story combined with concrete numbers outperforms pure data or pure narrative by 280%.

**Choose opening approach:**
- Option A: SPARK Framework (see `content types/spark.md`) - output must fit 120-150 characters
- Option B: Direct claim - state insight immediately
- Option C: Specific observation - ground in concrete moment, then extract insight

Justin Welsh (780K+ followers, $12M revenue): "Spend 80% of your time on opening lines, 20% on the rest."

**Write complete draft:**
- First 120-150 characters must hook before "see more"
- Develop single idea with brief context
- Ground abstract claims with specific details
- Natural paragraph breaks for mobile scanning
- Apply enforcement mechanisms from AGENTS.md (Bridge Check, Deletion Check)
- End with thought-provoking point or invitation to discuss

**Apply voice.md throughout** - builder's stance, honest confidence, results focus, no prohibited elements.

**Output:** Complete draft within target specifications.

### Step 4: Refine

**Run condensed preflight checks** (see AGENTS.md for full criteria):
- Clean prose (no hedging, meta-commentary, throat-clearing)
- Grounded claim (clear how you know this)
- Natural flow (bridge check passes, reads conversationally)
- Voice consistent (sounds like you, not "LinkedIn voice")

**Check for LinkedIn anti-patterns:**
- "Agree?" or "Thoughts?" engagement bait
- Artificial line breaks for algorithm manipulation
- Generic advice without specificity
- Corporate buzzword density
- Fake humility or false modesty
- Product promotion framing

**Verify:**
- Opening fits in 120-150 character preview
- Reading level at or below 4th grade
- Sounds like actual human professional

**Output:** Refined post ready to publish.

## Link Strategy

External links reduce reach by 25-40%. LinkedIn prioritizes keeping users on-platform.

**Options:**
1. **Post without link first** - Add link after traction builds (best reach preservation)
2. **"Link in comments"** - Mention in post body, place URL as first comment (75% conversion reduction vs inline)
3. **Multiple resource links** - Posts with 4+ links perform 3-5x better than single-link posts; algorithm distinguishes promotional single links from resource compilations

**Never:** Include YouTube links in posts (50% reach reduction). Use native video upload instead.

## Publication Behavior

Post timing and engagement behavior significantly impact algorithmic distribution.

**Optimal timing:**
- Tuesday through Thursday, 8-11 AM (audience's timezone)
- Wednesday 10 AM and Thursday 2 PM show particularly strong performance
- Avoid weekends and evenings after 7 PM

**Golden hour (first 60 minutes):**
- Target 15+ engagements in first hour to signal quality
- Below 500 impressions in first hour makes extended distribution unlikely

**Pre-publication ritual:**
- Engage meaningfully with 5-10 relevant posts in 15 minutes before publishing
- Increases reciprocal engagement likelihood

**Post-publication behavior:**
- Respond to comments within 90 minutes; algorithm penalizes "posting and ghosting"
- Engage with at least 5 additional posts after publishing
- Thoughtful replies that extend conversation, not "Thanks!"
- Comments over 15 words generate double algorithmic impact

**Frequency:**
- Space posts minimum 24 hours apart
- Same format consecutively (three carousels in a row) triggers 35% visibility reduction
- No penalty for high frequency if properly spaced

**Longevity:**
- LinkedIn resurfaces highly relevant posts for 2-3 weeks
- Evergreen expertise content outperforms time-sensitive material

## Quality Gates

**Mandatory checks (see AGENTS.md):**
- [ ] Bridge check passes
- [ ] Deletion check passes
- [ ] No prohibited elements

**Format-specific checks:**
- [ ] Opening fits 120-150 character preview window
- [ ] Single insight clearly developed
- [ ] Specific detail grounds abstract claim
- [ ] Reading level at or below 4th grade
- [ ] Sentence length averaging 8-10 words
- [ ] Sounds like human professional, not content marketing
- [ ] No LinkedIn anti-patterns present
- [ ] Length within target specifications
- [ ] No hashtags included
- [ ] Link strategy applied if external URL needed

## Platform-Specific Considerations

**Do:**
- Hook in first 120-150 characters
- Ground insight in specific observation or example
- Combine personal story with concrete numbers
- Use natural paragraph breaks for mobile readability
- Sound like yourself
- Create save-worthy content (saves carry 5x algorithmic weight)
- Craft content that invites thoughtful comments (10+ words)

**Don't:**
- Use hashtags (no longer functional)
- Include external links without mitigation strategy
- Use artificial line breaks to game algorithm
- End with "Agree?" or "Thoughts?" engagement bait
- Write above 4th-grade reading level
- Try to cover multiple insights
- Make it sound like content marketing
- Post same format consecutively
- Ignore first-hour engagement

## Common Failure Modes

**Generic advice syndrome:** Sharing obvious insights without specificity. Test: Would someone scroll past this because they've seen it 100 times?

**Corporate voice creep:** Sounding like company blog post rather than personal reflection. Test: Would you say this to a peer over coffee?

**Trying too hard:** Forced contrarianism, artificial controversy, or engagement manipulation tactics. Real insights don't need tricks.

**Burying the lead:** Starting with context instead of the insight. You have 120-150 characters before "see more" cuts you off.

**Multiple ideas competing:** Trying to cover 3-4 points in one post. Pick one. Develop it well.

**Template following:** Every post has identical structure. Real professionals have natural variation.

**Wrong format choice:** Using text-only when carousel or poll would multiply reach. Format selection happens before writing.

**Sophisticated language:** Writing at 10th-grade level when 4th-grade performs 35% better. Mobile readers scan; simple language wins.

**Product presentation framing:** Educational how-to content works. Product presentations lose 60-70% reach.

**Hashtag inclusion:** Wasted characters that provide no algorithmic benefit and may trigger spam detection at higher counts.
