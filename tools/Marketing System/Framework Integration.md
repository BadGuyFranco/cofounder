# Framework Integration Model

**When to load this file:** Load when building complex multi-framework outputs (webinar funnels, complete funnels, multi-asset campaigns). Skip for simple single-framework tasks like writing ad copy or a single email.

**Purpose:** Marketing outputs rarely use a single framework. This document shows how frameworks integrate into a unified system.

## Framework Hierarchy

**Foundational Frameworks (Always Apply):**
These frameworks apply to ALL marketing outputs and form the foundation:

1. **Hook-Story-Offer** - Universal structure for every piece of copy (ads, emails, pages, scripts)
2. **Value Ladder** - Informs offer positioning, pricing, and ascension strategy
3. **Secret Formula** - Defines Who (dream customer), Where (traffic), Bait (hook/offer), Result (outcome)
4. **Dream Customer** - Shapes all messaging, language, and angles

**Application-Specific Frameworks (Apply When Relevant):**
These frameworks apply to specific formats or situations:

- **Funnel Types** (`05-funnel-types/`) - Structure for complete funnels
- **Perfect Webinar** - For webinar/VSL presentations
- **Email Sequences** (`04-email/`) - For multi-email campaigns
- **Offer Frameworks** (`06-offers/`) - For offer construction
- **Traffic Frameworks** (`03-traffic/`) - For traffic strategy
- **Story Frameworks** (`01-identity-and-story/`) - For character and narrative

## Integration Patterns

**Common Framework Combinations:**

**Webinar Funnel:**
- Perfect Webinar (presentation structure)
- Email Sequences (reminder sequence + follow-up)
- Offer Framework (irresistible offer + stack slide)
- Hook-Story-Offer (applied to each email and page)
- Value Ladder (offer positioning)
- Traffic Temperature (messaging for cold/warm traffic)

**Sales Page:**
- Hook-Story-Offer (page structure)
- Offer Framework (irresistible offer + stack + bonuses + risk reversal)
- Epiphany Bridge (story structure within the Story component)
- Value Ladder (offer positioning and next steps)
- Attractive Character (voice and positioning)

**Email Sequence:**
- Soap Opera Sequence or Daily Seinfeld (sequence structure)
- Hook-Story-Offer (each email structure)
- Value Ladder (ascension path)
- Traffic Temperature (if sequence is for specific traffic source)

**Ad Copy:**
- Hook-Story-Offer (ad structure)
- Secret Formula (Who/Where/Bait)
- Traffic Temperature (messaging for traffic source)
- Preframe Bridges (if needed for cold traffic)

**Complete Funnel:**
- Funnel Type Framework (overall structure)
- Hook-Story-Offer (every page/email)
- Offer Framework (each offer in the funnel)
- Value Ladder (entire ascension path)
- Email Sequences (follow-up campaigns)
- Traffic Frameworks (traffic strategy)

## Layering Rules

**Order of Application:**

1. **Start with Foundational Frameworks**
   - Define dream customer (Secret Formula: Who)
   - Map value ladder position
   - Identify traffic source and temperature (Secret Formula: Where)

2. **Apply Format-Specific Framework**
   - If building a funnel → Load funnel type framework
   - If creating webinar → Load Perfect Webinar framework
   - If writing emails → Load email sequence framework

3. **Layer Offer Framework**
   - If creating/refining offers → Apply offer frameworks
   - Integrate with value ladder positioning

4. **Apply Hook-Story-Offer to Every Asset**
   - Every ad, email, page, script uses Hook-Story-Offer structure
   - This is the universal copy structure

5. **Add Story/Character Elements**
   - If using Epiphany Bridge → Integrate into Story component
   - If building Attractive Character → Apply to voice and positioning

**Priority When Frameworks Overlap:**

**General Rule:** Foundational frameworks > Format-specific frameworks > Supporting frameworks

**Specific Priority Rules:**

1. **Foundational frameworks override format-specific**
   - Hook-Story-Offer structure applies even if format framework doesn't mention it
   - Example: Perfect Webinar framework defines webinar flow, but every slide/segment still uses Hook-Story-Offer structure
   - Example: Soap Opera Sequence defines email sequence structure, but each email still uses Hook-Story-Offer

2. **Format-specific frameworks define structure**
   - Perfect Webinar defines webinar flow; Hook-Story-Offer structures the content within that flow
   - Funnel type frameworks define page sequence; Hook-Story-Offer structures each page
   - Email sequence frameworks define sequence flow; Hook-Story-Offer structures each email

3. **Offer frameworks inform content**
   - Offer Framework elements appear in the Offer component of Hook-Story-Offer
   - Stack Slide elements appear in the Offer section, not replacing Hook-Story-Offer structure
   - Example: In a sales page, Hook-Story-Offer provides structure; Offer Framework provides the content for the Offer component

4. **Value Ladder informs all decisions**
   - Every offer, upsell, and next step should align with value ladder position
   - Value Ladder thinking overrides individual framework suggestions if they conflict
   - Example: If Offer Framework suggests a price point that doesn't align with Value Ladder position, adjust to match Value Ladder

5. **Traffic frameworks inform messaging, not structure**
   - Traffic Temperature affects language and angles, not Hook-Story-Offer structure
   - Preframe Bridges add messaging elements, don't replace framework structure
   - Example: Cold traffic needs preframes, but the ad still uses Hook-Story-Offer structure

## Conflict Resolution

**Conflict:** Perfect Webinar says "present offer at minute 45" but Hook-Story-Offer says "Offer comes after Story"
- **Resolution:** Perfect Webinar defines timing; Hook-Story-Offer defines content structure. The offer section at minute 45 uses Hook-Story-Offer structure.

**Conflict:** Email sequence framework says "5 emails" but Value Ladder suggests immediate ascension
- **Resolution:** Value Ladder informs strategy. Adjust email sequence length or add ascension offers within the sequence structure.

**Conflict:** Offer Framework suggests $997 price but Value Ladder positions this as tripwire ($7-$37)
- **Resolution:** Value Ladder overrides. Adjust offer price to match Value Ladder position, then apply Offer Framework elements at that price point.

## Multi-Framework Verification

**When multiple frameworks apply, verify integration:**

1. **List All Applicable Frameworks**
   - Identify foundational frameworks (always apply)
   - Identify format-specific frameworks (based on output type)
   - Identify supporting frameworks (offer, traffic, story)

2. **Verify Each Framework Individually**
   - Check compliance with each framework's required components
   - Ensure no framework rules are violated

3. **Verify Integration Points**
   - Check that frameworks connect logically (e.g., Perfect Webinar's offer section uses Offer Framework)
   - Verify foundational frameworks are applied throughout (Hook-Story-Offer in every asset)
   - Ensure value ladder alignment across all offers and next steps

4. **Check for Conflicts**
   - If frameworks seem to conflict, prioritize: Foundational > Format-Specific > Supporting
   - Verify format-specific adaptations maintain core framework integrity

**Key Principle:** Frameworks don't replace each other - they layer together. A webinar funnel uses Perfect Webinar structure WITH Hook-Story-Offer content WITH Offer Framework elements WITH Email Sequence flow, all aligned to Value Ladder positioning.
