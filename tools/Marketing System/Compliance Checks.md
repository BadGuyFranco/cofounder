# Framework Compliance Checks

**When to load this file:** Load before final delivery of any marketing output. These are mandatory quality gates.

**If any check fails:** Fix it before delivering. These are not suggestions - they are required quality gates.

## Framework File Compliance Check

**When you've loaded a framework file, verify:**

1. **All Required Components Present**
   - Read through the framework file and identify all components, steps, or elements listed
   - Create a checklist of these components from the framework file
   - For each component in the checklist, verify it exists in your output
   - If the framework file explicitly marks components as "required" or "optional," prioritize required ones
   - If the framework file doesn't mark required/optional, treat all listed components as required unless context clearly indicates otherwise

2. **Component Order and Sequence**
   - Verify components appear in the correct order specified by the framework
   - Check that sequences flow logically (e.g., Hook before Story before Offer)
   - Ensure funnel steps follow the documented flow
   - If the framework file shows a numbered sequence or flow diagram, verify your output follows that exact order

3. **Framework-Specific Rules**
   - Review the framework file for specific rules, constraints, or "must" statements
   - Verify no framework rules are violated
   - Check that format-specific adaptations still maintain core framework integrity
   - Look for any "do not" or "avoid" statements in the framework file and verify compliance

## Universal Framework Compliance Checks

**Apply these checks to ALL marketing outputs:**

**Hook-Story-Offer Check**
- Does every ad, email, page, or script have a clear Hook, Story, and Offer?
- Is the Hook designed to interrupt patterns and create curiosity/desire (not sell)?
- Does the Story create an epiphany or belief shift?
- Is the Offer clear with a direct call to action?

**Value Ladder Check**
- Is the offer positioned correctly on the value ladder?
- Is there a logical next step for ascension?
- Are upsells/downsells appropriate for the ladder position?

**Dream Customer Alignment Check**
- Is the messaging aligned with the dream customer's desires?
- Does the language match their psychographics?
- Is the angle moving them away from pain or toward pleasure as intended?

**Offer Integrity Check**
- Does the offer include: promise, deliverables, speed/ease, risk reversal, scarcity/urgency?
- Is the price positioned correctly relative to value and ladder position?
- Is the offer stronger than just the product?

**Funnel Flow Check** (when building funnels)
- Does each step logically lead to the next?
- Is there proper pre-framing between steps?
- Are upsells/downsells positioned correctly?
- Is follow-up sequence planned?

**Traffic Temperature Check** (when applicable)
- Is the messaging matched to traffic temperature (hot/warm/cold)?
- Are preframe bridges in place for cold traffic?
- Does the hook match the traffic source?

**Multi-Framework Integration Check** (when multiple frameworks apply)
- Have you verified each framework individually?
- Are foundational frameworks (Hook-Story-Offer, Value Ladder) applied throughout?
- Do format-specific frameworks integrate properly with foundational frameworks?
- Are integration points verified? (e.g., Perfect Webinar's offer section uses Offer Framework)
- Does the output follow the Framework Integration Model for layering and priority?

## Preflight Checks (Before Final Output)

**Before delivering ANY marketing output, verify:**

1. **Framework Compliance** - All required framework elements present and in correct order
2. **No Framework Violations** - No rules from loaded framework files are broken
3. **Complete Structure** - If building a funnel, all pages/steps are outlined; if writing copy, all sections are complete
4. **Clear CTAs** - Every piece has a clear, direct call to action
5. **Message Consistency** - Ad copy pre-frames landing page; email sequences flow logically; funnel steps connect
6. **Offer Clarity** - Offer is clear, compelling, and properly positioned
7. **Dream Customer Alignment** - Language, angle, and messaging match the dream customer
