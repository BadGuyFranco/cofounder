# [METHODOLOGY] GTM System: AI Agent Instructions

## What This Is

Complete go-to-market system for the [METHODOLOGY] [CREDENTIAL] program. Contains demand validation, lead capture, sales conversion, delivery, and ongoing awareness strategies.


## How to Understand the System

1. **Start with `00-System-Summary.md`** for the complete overview
2. **Reference `01-Implementation-Todo.md`** for what needs to be done
3. **Use individual content files** (11-32) when building specific components


## File Numbering

```
00-02  Meta/Planning (overview, todo, analysis)
1X     Phase 1 content (Early Interest / Waitlist)
2X     Phase 2 content (Open for Sales)
3X     Phase 3 content (Delivery)
```


## Phase Lifecycle

**Critical:** Phases have different lifecycles.

| Phase | Lifecycle | What This Means |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Phase 1** | Done once done | After waitlist validates demand and sales open, Phase 1 is complete. No further iteration. |
| **Phase 2** | Ongoing | Sales infrastructure evolves. Each cohort launch may refine messaging, pricing, tactics. |
| **Phase 3** | Ongoing | Delivery improves with each cohort. Awareness compounds (testimonials, referrals). |

**When modifying content:**
- **Phase 1 files (1X):** Should rarely change after Phase 1 completes. If changing, confirm with user: "Phase 1 is typically complete. Are you reopening it?"
- **Phase 2 files (2X):** Expected to evolve. Update freely based on learnings.
- **Phase 3 files (3X):** Expected to evolve. Update based on cohort feedback.


## Working with the Todo List

`01-Implementation-Todo.md` is the **working document** for tracking progress.

**When making changes:**
- Check off completed tasks
- Update task status as work progresses
- Add notes about decisions made
- Reference which content file was used

**The todo is organized by phase:**
- Phase 1: Early Interest (validate demand)
- Phase 2: Open for Sales (build sales infrastructure)
- Phase 3: Delivery (run cohort, certify practitioners)

**Each phase has an awareness strategy:**
- `13-Awareness.md` - Phase 1
- `29-Awareness.md` - Phase 2
- `32-Awareness.md` - Phase 3

Complete phases in order. Phase 1 validates demand before investing in Phase 2 infrastructure.


## Handling Modifications to Completed Items

**When the user requests changes to something already checked off in the TODO:**

1. **Detect:** Look for the relevant task in `01-Implementation-Todo.md`. Is it marked `[x]` (completed)?

2. **Inform:** If completed, tell the user:
   > "This task was previously marked complete in the TODO. You're asking me to modify [specific thing]. This will require unchecking that item and potentially re-doing related work."

3. **Confirm:** Ask:
   > "Should I proceed with the change and mark this task as incomplete (unchecked)?"

4. **If yes:** Make the change and update the TODO:
   - Change `[x]` back to `[ ]`
   - Add a note: `(Revised [date] - [brief reason])`

5. **If no:** Do not make the change.

**Why this matters:** Completed items may have downstream dependencies. Changing copy that's already been built into a live page requires updating the live page too. The user needs to know they're reopening completed work.


## Adding New Awareness Ideas

When the user proposes new awareness tactics or ideas:

### Step 1: Question the Idea

Before incorporating, ask:

1. **Which phase does this serve?**
   - Phase 1: Building waitlist / validating demand
   - Phase 2: Converting to sales / filling cohort
   - Phase 3: Leveraging success / building flywheel

2. **What's the effort vs. impact?**
   - Low effort / High impact → Prioritize
   - High effort / Low impact → Question whether it's worth it
   - High effort / High impact → Worth it, but schedule carefully

3. **Does it replace something or add to it?**
   - If replacing: What's wrong with the current approach?
   - If adding: Is there capacity to do more, or does something need to be dropped?

4. **Is this a one-time tactic or ongoing?**
   - One-time: Add to TODO with specific deadline
   - Ongoing: Add to the awareness strategy doc for that phase

### Step 2: Incorporate into the Right Place

**If it's a new tactic for an existing phase:**
- Add to the relevant awareness doc (`13-Awareness.md`, `29-Awareness.md`, or `32-Awareness.md`)
- Add corresponding task(s) to `01-Implementation-Todo.md` in the appropriate stage
- If it requires new content (sample posts, templates), add that to the awareness doc

**If it's a new content asset (landing page variant, email, etc.):**
- Determine which phase it belongs to
- Create new file with appropriate number (e.g., `14-[Name].md` for Phase 1)
- Add to TODO
- Update `00-System-Summary.md` file index

**If it requires modifying existing content:**
- Follow the "Handling Modifications to Completed Items" process above

### Step 3: Confirm with User

Before making changes, summarize:
> "I'll add [tactic] to [phase] by:
> 1. [Specific change to awareness doc]
> 2. [Specific task added to TODO]
> 3. [Any other files affected]
>
> Does this look right?"


## Key Decisions to Track

When decisions are made (pricing, dates, platforms), update:
1. The relevant placeholders in content files
2. The decision checkboxes in `01-Implementation-Todo.md`


## Content File Usage

Each numbered file (11-32) contains ready-to-use copy. When building:
1. Find the relevant file for what you're building
2. Copy/adapt the content to your platform
3. Replace any bracketed placeholders with actual values
4. Check off the corresponding task in `01-Implementation-Todo.md`
```

# Phase 1 Awareness Strategy

Low-cost tactics for building the founding cohort waitlist.


## Primary Goal

Build a waitlist of [X]+ qualified prospects who have genuine interest in the [CREDENTIAL] program.


## Tactic 1: Warm Network Activation

**What:** Personal outreach to existing network before going public.

**Why:** Highest conversion rate; people who know you trust you.

**Actions:**
- Build list of warm contacts (colleagues, former clients, industry connections)
- Send personal 1:1 messages (not mass email)
- Ask for referrals: "Who else do you know who might benefit?"
- Follow up on expressed interest

**Effort:** Low
**Impact:** High


## Tactic 2: LinkedIn Content Strategy

**What:** Consistent posting to build awareness and drive waitlist signups.

**Why:** Primary platform for B2B professionals; organic reach still viable.

**Content Pillars:**
- Problem awareness (pain points your methodology solves)
- Methodology insights (share thinking without giving everything away)
- Behind-the-scenes (building the program, your journey)
- Contrarian takes (challenge conventional wisdom in [DOMAIN])
- Social proof (results, recognition, testimonials if available)

**Cadence:** 3-5 posts per week during waitlist phase

**Engagement Strategy:**
- Respond to all comments on your posts
- Comment meaningfully on others' posts in your space
- DM engaged commenters to start conversations (don't pitch immediately)

**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** High


## Tactic 3: Community Participation

**What:** Active presence in communities where your audience congregates.

**Why:** Builds credibility through demonstrated expertise; warm leads.

**Actions:**
- Identify 2-3 relevant communities (Slack, Discord, LinkedIn groups, etc.)
- Contribute value consistently (answer questions, share insights)
- Become known as helpful expert, not promoter
- When appropriate, mention waitlist in context of helping

**Effort:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium


## Tactic 4: Podcast Guesting (Optional)

**What:** Appear on podcasts your audience listens to.

**Why:** Builds credibility through association; reaches new audiences.

**Actions:**
- Identify target podcasts in your space
- Pitch valuable topics (not "my course is launching")
- Deliver genuine value in interviews
- Mention waitlist only if natural

**Effort:** High
**Impact:** Medium-High (depends on podcast reach)


## What NOT to Do

- Paid ads (not yet; validate organic demand first)
- Mass email blasts (personal outreach converts better)
- Aggressive promotion in communities (damages reputation)
- Overpromising or hype language (your audience detects this)


## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Waitlist signups | [X]+ |
| Quiz completions (if deployed) | [X]% of visitors |
| Referrals from waitlist | Track |
| Engagement rate on LinkedIn | Track |
| Community mentions/citations | Track |
```
