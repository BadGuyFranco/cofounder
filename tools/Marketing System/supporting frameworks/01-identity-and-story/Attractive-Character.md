# Attractive Character

The Attractive Character is the persona your audience connects with. It is the emotional and narrative anchor of your brand.  
People follow people—not companies—so the Attractive Character becomes the “face,” voice, and personality that builds trust, creates connection, and drives belief.

This framework ensures your marketing speaks *through a character*, not a faceless entity, creating familiarity, loyalty, and identity-based influence.


# Core Purpose of the Attractive Character

- Build deep emotional rapport  
- Create an ongoing narrative that customers want to follow  
- Increase trust, affinity, and connection  
- Make your audience feel like they “know” you  
- Pre-sell your offers before you pitch them  
- Turn content into a relationship rather than information  

The Attractive Character makes the audience WANT to hear from you because they are invested in your journey, personality, and perspective.


# The Four Core Elements of an Attractive Character

## 1. **Backstory**
Your personal journey that explains why you do what you do.

### Why It Matters
- Builds empathy  
- Creates relatability  
- Shows vulnerability  
- Establishes authenticity  

### Components
- Origin story  
- Struggles you faced  
- Discovery that changed everything  
- Transformation that brought you to today  

This is not resume material—it’s emotional material.


## 2. **Parables**
Short, illustrative stories that teach lessons tied to your core principles.

### Purpose
- Make teaching entertaining  
- Shift beliefs indirectly  
- Keep content memorable  
- Reinforce your identity and values  

Parables turn everyday experiences into teachable moments.


## 3. **Character Flaws**
Humans do not bond with perfection.  
They bond with shared imperfections.

### Purpose
- Makes you relatable  
- Builds trust  
- Softens resistance  
- Makes people root for you  

Examples:  
Fear of public speaking, past failures, struggles with confidence, self-doubt, procrastination.

### Rule
The Attractive Character must be real, imperfect, and emotionally open.


## 4. **Polarity**
Strong voices attract strong responses. Being neutral repels everyone.

### Purpose
- Stand out  
- Attract your real tribe  
- Repel the wrong buyers  
- Build authority through conviction  

Examples of polarity:  
- Contrarian views  
- Calling out industry myths  
- Unapologetic opinions  
- Bold claims backed by proof  


# Attractive Character Identity Types

Every Attractive Character takes on one of four identity archetypes.  
These archetypes help structure tone, story angle, and presentation style.


## 1. **The Leader**
You’ve achieved a transformation and now lead others toward it.

**Tone:** decisive, confident, directive  
**Positioning:** “Follow me—I’ll show you the way.”


## 2. **The Adventurer / Crusader**
You haven’t fully arrived yet. You’re learning and sharing the journey in real time.

**Tone:** curious, exploratory, authentic  
**Positioning:** “Let’s figure this out together.”


## 3. **The Reporter / Evangelist**
You curate the best ideas from others and share them with your audience.

**Tone:** investigative, studious, resourceful  
**Positioning:** “I’ve researched everything—here’s what works.”


## 4. **The Reluctant Hero**
You didn’t choose the spotlight; it chose you.  
You teach because you feel called or obligated after achieving success.

**Tone:** humble, empathetic, authentic  
**Positioning:** “I’m not special—so if I can do this, you can too.”
