# Preframe Bridges

A Preframe Bridge is a strategic piece of content placed *before* someone sees your funnel, ad, or sales page.  
Its purpose is to **pre-frame** the prospect’s mind so they arrive with the correct expectations, beliefs, and emotional state—making them far more likely to convert.

A Preframe Bridge answers this question:

**“What must someone think, feel, or understand BEFORE they see my offer so that my funnel works at maximum effectiveness?”**


# Core Purpose of Preframe Bridges

- Warm up cold audiences  
- Build trust before the pitch  
- Introduce key belief shifts early  
- Remove skepticism  
- Frame the vehicle as the logical solution  
- Increase click-through rate and conversion rate  
- Make ads cheaper and funnels more profitable  

Most traffic (especially cold) needs a preframe before entering the funnel.


# Why Preframes Work

Prospects rarely arrive neutral.  
They arrive with:

- Biases  
- Misconceptions  
- Skepticism  
- False beliefs  
- Emotional resistance  

A preframe *guides their interpretation* of what they’re about to see.

Example:  
If someone enters a webinar thinking “Webinars are just sales pitches,” they will resist the content.  
A preframe resets that expectation.


# Types of Preframe Bridges

There are seven main types of preframes. Each can be used alone or stacked.


## 1. **Email Preframes**

Emails sent before a webinar, challenge, VSL, or launch sequence.

### Purpose
- Build anticipation  
- Introduce key beliefs  
- Set expectations  
- Increase show-up rates  

### Examples
- “Why this webinar is different”  
- “The weird discovery I’m revealing tomorrow”  
- “Here’s what you must know before we start”  


## 2. **Content Preframes**

Organic content designed to warm the audience.

### Formats
- Social posts  
- Blog posts  
- YouTube videos  
- Short-form content  
- Podcast episodes  

### Purpose
Tie content themes directly to your eventual offer.

Example:  
A video explaining the “real reason people fail at losing weight” primes the mind for a fitness funnel.


## 3. **Advertorials / Bridge Pages**

Long-form written pages that sit between ads and funnels.

### Purpose
- Bridge cold traffic to your story  
- Build rapport  
- Introduce the new opportunity  
- Break 1–2 core false beliefs  

### Structure
- Curiosity hook  
- Short story  
- Insight  
- Soft CTA into the funnel  


## 4. **Quiz Preframes**

Quizzes help prospects self-identify their own problems.

### Purpose
- Create personalized relevance  
- Build curiosity  
- Collect data  
- Increase engagement  

### Examples
- “What type of funnel do you need?”  
- “What’s your marketing bottleneck?”  

The quiz result page serves as the final bridge into the offer.


## 5. **Case Study Preframes**

Case studies set expectations for success.

### Purpose
- Show real transformation  
- Build trust  
- Demonstrate the vehicle works  
- Pre-handle objections  

### Formats
- Video mini-doc  
- Written case study  
- Interview-style breakdown  

These are especially effective for VSL and webinar funnels.


## 6. **Influencer / Dream 100 Preframes**

Borrowed authority opportunities.

### Examples
- Podcast interviews  
- Collaborations  
- Guest trainings  
- Newsletter swaps  

### Purpose
The influencer’s endorsement serves as the preframe.


## 7. **Challenge or Workshop Preframes**

Short, free trainings that prepare the audience.

### Purpose
- Build belief  
- Teach foundational concepts  
- Nurture community  
- Increase intent  

Example:  
A 3-day “prep challenge” before a paid challenge funnel.


# How to Choose the Right Preframe

### For Cold Traffic:
Use content, advertorials, quizzes, or case studies.

### For Warm Traffic:
Use email preframes, influencer preframes, or content pieces.

### For Hot Traffic:
Minimal preframes—just reminders or value-reinforcing emails.


# Preframe Bridge Structure (Universal Script)

Every Preframe Bridge should follow this sequence:

1. **Pattern interrupt**  
2. **Big Promise / Insight**  
3. **Story or example**  
4. **Belief shift**  
5. **Soft CTA into the funnel**  

Even a 30-second video can follow this.


# Preframes and Funnel Optimization

Using preframes improves:

- CTR (Click-Through Rate)  
- EPC (Earnings Per Click)  
- AOV (Average Order Value)  
- Lead cost  
- Sales conversion  

Funnels often fail not because the offer is weak, but because prospects entered without proper pre-framing.


# Common Preframe Mistakes

- Trying to sell too early  
- Making the preframe too long or too complex  
- Not addressing the key objections upfront  
- Not linking the preframe logically to the funnel  
- Being boring—preframes must hook immediately  


# Summary

A Preframe Bridge is any strategic content placed BEFORE your core funnel to:

- Shift beliefs  
- Add context  
- Warm up the audience  
- Reduce resistance  
- Increase conversions  

By controlling how prospects interpret what they’re about to see, you dramatically improve the effectiveness of your funnels—especially with cold traffic.
