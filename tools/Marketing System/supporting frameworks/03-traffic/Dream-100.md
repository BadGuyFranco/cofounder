# Dream 100

The Dream 100 is a strategic traffic and relationship-building framework focused on identifying and targeting the top 100 people, platforms, or companies who already have the attention of your dream customers.  
Instead of trying to win the market directly, you concentrate your efforts on the few key players who can give you access to the audiences you want.

This approach multiplies reach, creates warm traffic sources, and builds high-leverage partnerships.


# Core Purpose of the Dream 100

- Identify where your dream customers already congregate  
- Build relationships with the gatekeepers of those congregations  
- Borrow traffic, trust, and authority from established audiences  
- Create predictable and scalable collaboration and promotion opportunities  
- Eliminate the need to “start from scratch” when building an audience  

The Dream 100 strategy is responsible for many of the largest business growth breakthroughs because it replaces cold outreach with relationship-driven distribution.
