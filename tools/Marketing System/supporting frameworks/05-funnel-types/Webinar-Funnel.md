# Webinar Funnel

A Webinar Funnel is a high-conversion sales system that uses a live or automated webinar to educate, shift beliefs, and present a high-value offer at scale.  
It is one of the most powerful ways to sell mid-ticket and high-ticket products because it leverages **story, education, belief transformation, and live presenter authority**.

Webinars work especially well for:
- Courses  
- Coaching programs  
- Memberships  
- Consulting  
- Software  
- Done-for-you services  
- High-ticket application funnels  


# Core Purpose of a Webinar Funnel

- Build trust through structured teaching  
- Break false beliefs systematically  
- Present your vehicle as the only logical path  
- Create emotional desire and logical conviction  
- Pitch a high-value offer with urgency  
- Convert a large number of viewers at once  
- Warm cold/warm traffic rapidly  
- Provide a complete buying experience in one sitting  

A webinar is essentially a **Perfect Webinar** delivered inside a funnel.


# Webinar Funnel Flow (Overview)

The standard webinar funnel includes:

1. **Registration Page**  
2. **Confirmation Page**  
3. **Email/SMS Reminder Sequence**  
4. **Live or Automated Webinar Broadcast Room**  
5. **Offer Page / Sales Page**  
6. **Post-Webinar Follow-Up Sequence**  
7. **Replay Page** (optional but common)  

This funnel can be run live or automated (evergreen).


# 1. Registration Page

### Purpose
Get visitors to register for the webinar by promising a specific transformation.

### Core Components
- Strong headline (promise-focused)  
- Presenter credibility  
- 3–5 bullet points about what they’ll discover  
- Countdown timer (if live)  
- Engaging registration button  
- Social proof (optional)  

### Key Principles
- Sell the *transformation*, not the webinar  
- Keep messaging simple and outcome-driven  
- Use a compelling hook tied to your Big Domino belief  


# 2. Confirmation Page

### Purpose
Reinforce their decision and increase show-up rate.

### Components
- “You’re in!” message  
- Instructions for adding the event to their calendar  
- Short video from the presenter  
- Bonus training or resource to increase commitment  
- Preview of what they’ll learn  
- CTA to share the event  

The entire page is focused on **getting them to show up**.


# 3. Email/SMS Reminder Sequence

Show-up rate is one of the biggest levers in webinar success.

### Essential Reminders
- Immediately after registration  
- 24 hours before  
- Morning of  
- 15 minutes before  
- 5 minutes before  
- “We’re starting now!”  

### Messaging Focus
- Excitement  
- Curiosity  
- Urgency  
- Testimonials  
- Big promise reminders  

These reminders drastically lift attendance.


# 4. The Webinar Broadcast

This is the core conversion event.  
Most webinar funnels use the **Perfect Webinar Framework**, including:

### The Webinar Structure
1. Introduction (Promise + Credibility + Big Domino)  
2. Secret #1 — Vehicle belief shift  
3. Secret #2 — Internal belief shift  
4. Secret #3 — External belief shift  
5. Transition to the pitch  
6. Stack & offer  
7. Q&A + objection handling  

### Why Webinars Convert So Well
- Long-form content builds deep belief  
- Stories bypass resistance  
- Teaching positions you as an authority  
- The Stack Slide increases perceived value  
- The pitch is emotionally and logically aligned  

Webinar conversion rates:  
- Live: 5–20%  
- Evergreen: 2–10%


# 5. The Offer Page

After the webinar, viewers are sent to a direct sales page.

### This page should include:
- Headline tied to the Big Domino  
- Breakdown of your offer  
- Stack section  
- Bonuses  
- Guarantee  
- Testimonials  
- Scarcity/urgency  
- Clear CTA buttons  

This page mirrors the pitch delivered in the webinar.


# 6. Post-Webinar Follow-Up Sequence

This is where much of your revenue happens.

### The Follow-Up Sequence Should Include:
- “Replay is live” email  
- “Key takeaway” emails  
- Case studies  
- FAQ emails  
- Urgency reminders  
- Last day / last chance emails  

Follow-up commonly doubles webinar sales.


# 7. Replay Page (Optional, But Powerful)

Replay pages increase conversions for people who:

- Registered but missed live  
- Left early  
- Want to rewatch key parts  
- Need more time to make a decision  

Replay pages often include **limited viewing windows** for urgency.


# Types of Webinar Funnels

### 1. Live Webinar Funnel
Great for:
- High-ticket items  
- Community building  
- First-time launches  
- Market testing  

### 2. Automated / Evergreen Webinar Funnel

Maximizes convenience and reduces drop-off.


# Webinar Funnel Metrics

### Critical KPIs
- Registration conversion % (25–50%)  
- Show-up rate (20–40% live, 10–25% evergreen)  
- Watch time (minimum 40–60%)  
- Conversion rate (5–20%)  
- Cost per lead

Each stage can be optimized for huge gains.


# Common Mistakes

- Teaching too much (instead of shifting beliefs)  
- Weak Big Domino

- Boring delivery or low energy  
- No clear Stack or value presentation  
- No urgency or scarcity

A webinar must be emotionally engaging and strategically designed.
