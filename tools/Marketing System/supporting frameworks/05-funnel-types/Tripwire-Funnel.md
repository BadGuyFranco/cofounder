# Tripwire Funnel

A Tripwire Funnel is a low-ticket, high-value front-end funnel designed to convert leads into **buyers** quickly by offering an irresistible, low-cost product (typically $7–$47).  
The primary purpose is NOT profit—it’s to transform cold leads into paying customers and accelerate the ascension into mid-ticket and high-ticket offers.

Once someone buys *anything*, even a small product, their likelihood of buying again increases dramatically.  
A Tripwire Funnel deliberately leverages this psychological shift.


# Core Purpose of a Tripwire Funnel

- Convert leads into buyers at the lowest possible friction  
- Build trust rapidly with a fast-delivered win  
- Ascend customers into higher levels of your Value Ladder  
- Offset or break even on ad spend  
- Qualify serious prospects  
- Increase AOV (Average Order Value) via bumps and upsells  
- Create a profitable front-end ecosystem  

It is one of the most effective funnels for stabilizing acquisition.


# Psychological Foundation

### 1. Micro-Commitment  
A small financial commitment trains the customer to buy again.

### 2. Reciprocity  
Delivering massive value for a tiny cost builds goodwill.

### 3. Perceived Value > Price  
The offer must feel “too good to say no to.”

### 4. Buying Momentum  
A low-friction purchase sets the stage for higher-ticket ascension.


# Structure of a Tripwire Funnel

A typical Tripwire Funnel includes:

1. **Lead Magnet Page (Optional but Recommended)**  
2. **Tripwire Sales Page**  
3. **Order Form + Order Bump**  
4. **Upsell #1 (OTO1)**  
5. **Upsell #2 (OTO2)**  
6. **Downsell(s)**  
7. **Thank You Page**  
8. **Follow-Up Sequences**

Let’s break down each.


# 1. Lead Magnet (Optional)

### Purpose  
Collect leads at low friction and warm them for the tripwire offer.

### Effective Lead Magnet Types  
- Templates  
- Checklists  
- Cheatsheets  
- Mini-courses  
- Tools or calculators  

This increases opt-in rate and reduces acquisition cost.


# 2. Tripwire Sales Page

### Purpose  
Sell the low-ticket offer with clarity and urgency.

### Essential Components
- Bold headline (simple + outcome-driven)  
- Strong hero section with visuals  
- Clear explanation of what they get  
- Quick-win transformation  
- Emphasis on *speed* and *simplicity*  
- Scarcity/urgency (limited pricing, temporary deal)  
- Testimonials and proof  
- CTA: “Unlock Instant Access”  

### Tripwire Offer Criteria  
The offer must be:

- Low-risk  
- Fast to consume  
- High in perceived value  
- Solves a very specific micro-problem  
- Directly connected to your core vehicle/offer  

Examples:
- Swipe files  
- Toolkits  
- Templates  
- Mini-workshops  
- Script packs  
- “Fast Start” trainings  


# 3. Order Form + Order Bump

### Purpose  
Increase immediate revenue.

### Order Bump Must Be:
- Related to the tripwire  
- Priced between $17–$47  
- A convenience or speed add-on  

Examples:
- “Pro” version  
- Additional templates  
- Audio version  
- Implementation workbook  

Order bumps often convert at 20–60%.


# 4. Upsell #1 (OTO1)

### Purpose  
Present the next logical step.

### Characteristics  
- Price: $47–$197  
- Short VSL explaining the transformation  
- Clear stack and bonuses  
- Promise accelerated or amplified results  

Examples:
- A more complete course  
- Multi-video training  
- Masterclass  
- Blueprint program  


# 5. Upsell #2 (OTO2)

### Purpose  
Capture additional revenue from those wanting deeper guidance.

### Characteristics  
- Price: $97–$497  
- More advanced or comprehensive  
- Could include coaching, community, or continuity trial  

Examples:

# 6. Downsells

### Purpose  
Recover missed revenue by offering alternatives.

Examples:
- “Lite” version  
- Trial period  
- Payment plan  
- Reduced scope  

Downsells allow more buyers to continue ascending.


# 7. Thank You Page

### Purpose  
Deliver the tripwire and continue the relationship.

### Components

- CTA for next step (webinar, video, challenge, application)  
- Social community invite  
- Expectation setting for emails  


# 8. Follow-Up Sequences

Your tripwire buyers should immediately enter:

- **A post-purchase nurture sequence**  
- **A conversion campaign for the next product**  
- **Daily Seinfeld emails**  
- **Retargeting ads**  

Tripwire buyers often ascend quickly when nurtured properly.


# Tripwire Funnel Metrics

### Key KPIs
- Cost Per Acquisition (CPA)  
- Tripwire conversion rate  
- Order bump take rate  
- AOV

A winning Tripwire Funnel should aim to **break even** on cold traffic.


# Common Mistakes

- Poor alignment between tripwire + upsells  
- Selling too hard too fast  
- Weak story or weak belief bridge
