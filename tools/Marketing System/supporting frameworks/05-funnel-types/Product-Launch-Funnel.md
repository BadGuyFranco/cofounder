# Product Launch Funnel

A Product Launch Funnel is a multi-step, narrative-driven funnel designed to build anticipation, educate prospects, shift beliefs, and generate a massive surge of sales during a defined launch window.  
It typically unfolds over several days through a sequence of pre-launch content videos or emails, leading to an open cart period where the core offer becomes available.

This funnel is built around **orchestrated tension**, **storytelling**, **education**, and **event-based urgency**—making it one of the most powerful ways to sell courses, memberships, coaching, SaaS, and information products.


# Core Purpose of a Product Launch Funnel

- Warm cold and warm traffic before opening the cart  
- Deliver transformational pre-launch content that shifts beliefs  
- Build excitement and anticipation  
- Create demand before the offer is available  
- Make the opening of the cart feel like an EVENT  
- Present your vehicle as the only logical choice  
- Drive a surge of sales during cart open  
- Maximize urgency during cart close  

This funnel is engineered to move large volumes of people through a belief-shifting journey.


# Why Product Launch Funnels Work

### 1. Educate Before Selling  
People become more ready to buy after consuming structured, high-value content.

### 2. Story-Driven  
Launch videos build emotional connection and resonate deeply.

### 3. High Perceived Value  
You deliver genuine transformation *before* asking for money.

### 4. Scarcity + Urgency  
Limited open cart windows activate buying behavior.

### 5. Tribal Momentum  
Everyone moves through the experience together.

### 6. Sequence-Based Belief Shifting  
Each piece of pre-launch content strategically breaks one category of belief.

# Key Metrics for Product Launch Funnels

- No urgency or soft deadlines  
- Having vague or broad promises
