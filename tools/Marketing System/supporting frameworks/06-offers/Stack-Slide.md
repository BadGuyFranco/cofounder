# Stack and Stack Slide Framework

The Stack (and Stack Slide) Framework is a structured, visual, and psychological method for presenting the components of your offer in a way that massively increases perceived value and reduces buyer resistance.  
It organizes your offer into clearly defined deliverables, each with its own framed value, and “stacks” them one by one so the offer feels bigger, more valuable, and more compelling with every slide or section.

This is one of the MOST important frameworks in selling—especially in webinars, VSLs, sales pages, and stage presentations.


# Core Purpose of the Stack

- Increase perceived value  
- Justify your price  
- Make the offer feel comprehensive  
- Reduce objections by showing completeness  
- Create excitement and anticipation  
- Build belief through visual momentum  
- Dramatically increase conversion rates  

The Stack transforms your offer from a “product” into a “complete solution.”


# Why the Stack Works

The Stack leverages multiple psychological principles:

### 1. **Value Amplification Through Segmentation**  
Breaking your offer into parts increases perceived value.

### 2. **Chunking**  
People understand complex systems better when broken down.

### 3. **Anchoring**  
Every item has its own price anchor, building toward a massive total value.

### 4. **Momentum**  
As the stack grows visually, buyers feel like they're getting more and more.

### 5. **Loss Aversion**  
If they say no, they feel like they’re losing an entire stack of value.

### 6. **Contrast Effect**  
The total stacked value makes your price look tiny.

The Stack is not optional—it is conversion infrastructure.


# The Components of a Proper Stack

Every strong stack includes:

1. **Core Offer (Vehicle + Main Deliverables)**  
2. **Individual Value Assignments**  
3. **Bonuses**  
4. **Bonus Value Assignments**  
5. **Stack Slide Visualization**  
6. **Total Value Reveal**  
7. **Price Reveal (Contrast)**  
8. **Guarantee (Risk Reversal)**  
9. **Scarcity / Urgency**  
10. **Final CTA**  

Let’s break each one down.


# 1. Core Offer Deliverables

This is your main program or product.

Examples:
- Course modules  
- Coaching program  
- Software suite  
- Certification system  
- Membership access  

### Each deliverable MUST be:
- Clearly named  
- Tangible  
- Outcome-based  
- Easy to visualize  

Example:  
“Module 1: Build Your Funnel Foundation”


# 2. Individual Value Assignments

Every deliverable needs a dollar value.

This value should reflect:
- Replacement cost  
- Market price  
- ROI  
- What competitors charge  

Value assignment example:
- “Module 1: Funnel Foundations — $497 Value”  

Without value assignments, you cannot anchor your price.


# 3. Bonuses

Bonuses exist to remove objections and increase ease/speed.

### Bonus Criteria:
- Must solve a specific barrier  
- Must complement the core offer  
- Must accelerate the transformation  

Examples:
- “Fast Start Templates”  
- “Accountability Group”  
- “Swipe File Library”  


# 4. Bonus Value Assignments

Each bonus gets its own value.

Examples:
- “Bonus: Funnel Templates — $297 Value”  
- “Bonus: Weekly Coaching Calls — $997 Value”  

Value stacking is essential for anchoring.


# 5. Visual Stack Slide

A visually designed “stack slide” is shown in:
- Webinars  
- VSLs  
- Sales pages  
- Presentations  
- Product launch funnels  

### Elements of the Stack Slide:
- Visual images/mockups  
- Title of each deliverable  
- Value of each item  
- Layer-by-layer stacking  
- Total stacked value at the bottom  

The visual stacking increases perceived substance.


# 6. Total Value Reveal

Add up the individual values.

Example:
- Core Program: $1,997  
- Templates: $297  
- Coaching Calls: $997  
- Swipe Files: $497  
- Private Community: $297  

**Total Value: $4,085**

This number creates the anchor.


# 7. Price Reveal (Contrast)

After revealing the total value, show your price.

Example:
“Your investment today is not $4,085…  
Not $1,000…  
But just $297.”

### Contrast = justification + emotional relief.


# 8. Guarantee (Risk Reversal)

### Role of Guarantee in the Stack:
- Reduces perceived risk  
- Increases trust  
- Helps hesitant buyers move forward  

Example:
“Try the program for 30 days. If you don’t get results, get a full refund.”

This typically comes *after* the price reveal.


# 9. Scarcity / Urgency

These elements increase conversions by driving immediate action.

Types of scarcity:
- Limited seats  
- Limited enrollment window  
- Only available during webinar  
- Fast-action bonuses  

Types of urgency:
- Deadline timers  
- Cart closing  
- Bonus expiring  
- Price increasing soon  


# 10. Final CTA

The final CTA should be crystal clear.

Examples:
- “Click the button to enroll now.”  
- “Join the program before doors close.”  
- “Secure your spot before bonuses disappear.”  

The CTA is repeated multiple times as you cycle through the Stack during pitch.


# The “Stack Loop”

In webinars, the presenter cycles back through the stack multiple times:

1. Present the stack  
2. Reveal the price  
3. Add bonuses  
4. Rebuild the stack  
5. Re-anchor  
6. CTA  
7. Add urgency  
8. CTA again  
9. Add guarantee  
10. CTA again  

This repetition reinforces value and increases conversions.


# Example of a Complete Stack

**Core Offer:**  
- 8-Week Funnel Mastery Program ($1,997 value)

**Bonuses:**  
- Funnel Template Pack ($297 value)  
- Swipe File Vault ($497 value)  
- Weekly Q&A Calls ($997 value)  
- Private Community Access ($297 value)  

**Total Value:** $3,085  
**Your Price Today:** $297  
**Guarantee:** 30-Day Risk-Free  
**Scarcity:** Limited enrollment  
**CTA:** “Enroll Now”

This creates the “irresistible” feeling.


# Summary

The Stack and Stack Slide Framework transforms your offer by:

- Breaking deliverables into high-value components  
- Assigning perceived values  
- Adding bonuses that eliminate objections  
- Using visuals to increase clarity and substance  
- Anchoring with a high total value  
- Contrasting with a much lower price  
- Adding guarantee, scarcity, and urgency  
- Reinforcing the CTA repeatedly  

When combined correctly, the Stack becomes one of the most powerful sales mechanisms in modern marketing and is responsible for millions in revenue across funnels, webinars, VSLs, and launches.
