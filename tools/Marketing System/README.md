**Offer clarity:** Every funnel has clear, compelling offers with strong value propositions

**Conversion-focused:** All elements drive toward specific conversion actions and customer ascension

**Authenticity matters:** Even in sales-focused marketing, authenticity and genuine value creation are non-negotiable. No manipulative tactics or false scarcity.
