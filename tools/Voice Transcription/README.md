# Voice Transcription

100% local voice transcription using OpenAI Whisper. No API keys, completely free, runs entirely on your machine.

## When to Use

Use Voice Transcription when:
- Converting meetings, calls, or voice recordings to text
- Privacy is critical (sensitive or confidential audio)
- Processing multiple files without per-use costs
- Creating meeting notes or documentation from audio
- User has local audio files ready to transcribe

Don't use Voice Transcription when:
- Audio is still being recorded (this is post-recording only)
- Real-time transcription is needed (this processes complete files)
- User wants cloud service convenience over privacy
- Audio quality is extremely poor (though Whisper handles most cases well)
