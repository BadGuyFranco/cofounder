My content creation workspace.

## Workspace Structure

- **`/memory/`** - My configuration (voice, API keys)
- **`/[Your Name]/`** - My content (this workspace)

## Writing Content

For any writing task:

1. Load `/cofounder/tools/Content Author/AGENTS.md`
2. Apply my voice from `/memory/tools/Content Author/voice.md`
3. Save output to `/[Your Name]/content/`
