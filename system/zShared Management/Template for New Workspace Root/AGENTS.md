# [Workspace Name] - AI Agent Instructions

[One-sentence description of what AI agents do in this workspace]

## Workspace Structure

This workspace has multiple root directories:

- **`/pro accelerator/`** - Shared libraries and tools (read-only, universal access)
- **`/[Your Workspace Name]/`** - Active workspace (read/write)
[Optional: - **`/[Reference Workspace]/`** - Reference only (read-only, for context)]

**AI Agent Rules:**
- You can read from any root directory
- Only modify files in `/[Your Workspace Name]/` unless explicitly instructed
- `/pro accelerator/` contains universal tools and documentation (COREGUIDE.md, Browser Control, etc.)
[Optional: - Never modify `/[Reference Workspace]/` - reference only for foundation/context]

## Primary Constraint

[State the most critical rule for this workspace - e.g., "Always use the Editor in Chief tool before creating content" or "Never modify files in `/git/` unless explicitly instructed"]

## Foundation Documents (Reference Every Time)

**Purpose:** [Why this document is foundational - e.g., "The principles that guide all content" or "Defines the methodology"]

**When to Reference:**

- [Scenario 2]
- [Scenario 3]

### 2. Core Guide - Voice and Rules
**Location:** `/pro accelerator/COREGUIDE.md`

**Status:** NEVER MODIFY UNLESS EXPLICITLY TOLD TO DO SO

**Purpose:** Defines voice, style, rules, and quality standards for all writing.

**When to Reference:**
- Before writing or editing any content
