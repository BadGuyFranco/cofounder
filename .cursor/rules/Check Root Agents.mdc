# Check Root AGENTS.md

A workspace root is missing its AGENTS.md file. This file provides workspace-specific instructions that help the AI understand the purpose and structure of each workspace.

## Step 1: Identify Missing Files

Check each path in `user_info.Workspace Paths`. For each path that is NOT `/cofounder/`:
- If `AGENTS.md` does not exist in that root, it needs to be created

List the folders missing AGENTS.md and ask the user:

"The following workspace roots are missing AGENTS.md files:
- [list folders]

Would you like me to create them? This helps me understand each workspace's purpose."

If the user declines, proceed without creating files.

## Step 2: Create Missing Files

For each missing AGENTS.md:

**If the folder is `/memory/`:**
Copy from `/cofounder/system/templates/Memory Templates/memory-root-AGENTS.md`

**If the folder is any other workspace:**
Copy from `/cofounder/system/templates/Personal Workspace Template/AGENTS.md`, then:
1. Replace `[Your Name]` with the folder name
2. Remove the "Template Instructions" section

## Step 3: Confirm

Tell the user which files were created and resume the original task.
