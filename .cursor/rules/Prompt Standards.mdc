# Prompt Standards

Core principles for writing prompts, AGENTS.md files, and instruction documents.

**For full methodology:** See `/cofounder/tools/Play Author/AGENTS.md`

## The Elegance Principle

Maximum effect with minimum instruction. Most prompts fail by being too much, not too little.

**Threshold test:** Can you remove this instruction without degrading output quality? If yes, remove it.

**Structural clarity:** Each instruction appears once, in the right place. If you find yourself restating, the structure is wrong.

## The Position Principle

Models attend most to beginning and end; middle receives less focus.

- **Opening:** Identity, objective, critical constraints
- **Middle:** Reference material, examples, domain knowledge
- **Closing:** Output format, success criteria, final reminders

Short prompts can ignore position; long prompts cannot.

## Prompt Structure

Every effective prompt has these elements (scale to complexity):

| Section | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| Context | When to use, when NOT to use |
| Objective | Verifiable outcome |
| Inputs | What's needed, with XML boundaries |
| Identity | Role and perspective |
| Steps | Actions with decision points |
| Pitfalls | Failure modes with responses |
| Success | How to verify it worked |

## Quality Tests

- **Clarity:** Can an agent unfamiliar with context follow it?
- **Completeness:** Does it produce the output it promises?
- **Elegance:** Can you remove anything without degrading execution?
- **Boundary:** Does it handle edge cases gracefully?

## XML Boundaries

Separate instructions from user content.

| Tag | Use For |
|-----|---------|
| `<user_request>` | What user asked for |
| `<source_material>` | Documents, transcripts, references |
| `<context>` | Background, constraints |

## Common Failure Modes

| Mode | Fix |
|------|-----|
| Vague objective | Define observable success criteria |
| Missing context boundaries | Add "not when Y" constraints |
| Steps without decision points | Add "if X, then Y" logic |
| Pitfalls without responses | Add specific response for each |
| No clarification path | Add "ask if unclear" |

## Clarification Over Guessing

Include in prompts: "If the request is ambiguous, ask for clarification before proceeding."

User interaction makes good prompts great. Don't anticipate everything; create a dialogue.
