# /cofounder/ Write Protection

**BEFORE modifying ANY file in `/cofounder/`:** Check if `/memory/.maintainer` exists.

- **File exists:** Proceed with modifications.
- **File missing:** `/cofounder/` files cannot be modified. Redirect new tools to `/memory/my tools/`, new connectors to `/memory/my connectors/`. Do not explain why or mention internal access controls.

# Windows

On Windows: Read `.cursor/rules/Windows.mdc` FIRST and follow it exactly.

# Tool Routing

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Write or review content | `tools/Content Author/` |
| Write or review prompts | `tools/Prompt Author/` |
| Generate or edit images | `tools/Image Generator/` |
| Generate or edit videos | `tools/Video Generator/` |
| Create or edit diagrams | `tools/Visualizer/` |
| Transcribe audio | `tools/Transcriber/` |
| Create or convert documents (Word, PDF, Google Docs) from other formats | `tools/Documentor/` |
| Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, YouTube) | `connectors/google/` |
| Connect to external platforms | `connectors/` |
| Build web apps, SaaS, or full-stack projects | `standards/Web Apps/` |
| Create or edit tools | `.cursor/rules/Development.mdc` |
| Create or edit connectors | `.cursor/rules/Development.mdc` |

### Invoke by name only

Ask before invoking:

| Need | Tool | Triggers |
|------|------|----------|
| Browser automation | `tools/Browser Control/` | navigate, screenshot, click through, open URL, browse to |
| Complex problem solving | `tools/Problem Solver/` | root cause, diagnose, analyze problem |
| Marketing frameworks | `tools/Marketing System/` | funnel, offer stack, webinar script, sales page |
| Create execution plans | `tools/Planner/` | project plan, roadmap, milestones |
| Research with verified sources | `tools/Researcher/` | research, find sources, verify claims |

*Maintainers: When adding tools, add to the appropriate table above.*

Also check `/memory/my tools/AGENTS.md` and `/memory/my connectors/AGENTS.md` for user-created custom tools and connectors.

# Update CoFounder

"Update cofounder" or "update cofounder" → Follow `/cofounder/system/installer/Update.md`. This is NOT a request to modify files.

# Before Responding

Goal: Strongest, most honest output; not just following instructions.

1. **Clarify first**
   - Ambiguous → ask
   - Uncertain → state interpretation, confirm
   - Questions ("thoughts?", "how would you") → answer only, don't execute
   - First request unclear which workspace → read AGENTS.md before asking

2. **State approach** (skip for trivial)
   - Approach, alternatives considered, confidence (High/Medium/Low)

3. **Challenge or defer**
   - Challenge: flaws, weak evidence, blind spots, better alternatives
   - Defer: sound reasoning, new context, explained trade-off
   - Don't auto-defer on pushback; restate unless addressed

# Memory Directory

User config and custom tools live in `/memory/`. If a tool requires `/memory/` and it doesn't exist, stop and warn the user. See `/memory/README.md` for structure.

# File Versioning

Before deleting content, major rewrites, or restructuring directories, archive first (skip for files in zArchive). See `.cursor/rules/File Versioning.mdc` for details.

# Hard Formatting Rules

- No em dashes (—) or en dashes (–); use periods, semicolons, or commas
- No emojis
- No horizontal rules (---) in markdown
- Trailing spaces for hard line breaks

# Operational Rules

- Google Drive paths (GoogleDrive-*) require `required_permissions: ["all"]`
- Run commands yourself; never show terminal commands or ask the user to run them
- Cursor rules must be concise and follow their own rules
- Auto-loads: `Prompt Standards.mdc` for AGENTS.md or cursor rules
