# Tool Routing

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Write or review content | `tools/Content Author/` |
| Write or review prompts | `tools/Prompt Author/` |
| Generate or edit images | `tools/Image Generator/` |
| Generate or edit videos | `tools/Video Generator/` |
| Create or edit diagrams | `tools/Visualizer/` |
| Transcribe audio | `tools/Transcriber/` |
| Create or convert documents (Word, PDF, Google Docs) from other formats | `tools/Documentor/` |
| Build web apps | `tools/Web Tech Stack/` |
| Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets, Slides, Drive, Gmail, Calendar, YouTube) | `connectors/google/` |
| Connect to external platforms | `connectors/` |
| Create or edit tools | `.cursor/rules/Development.mdc` |
| Create or edit connectors | `.cursor/rules/Development.mdc` |

### Invoke by name only

Ask before invoking:

| Need | Tool | Triggers |
|------|------|----------|
| Browser automation | `tools/Browser Control/` | navigate, screenshot, click through, open URL, browse to |
| Complex problem solving | `tools/Problem Solver/` | root cause, diagnose, analyze problem |
| Marketing frameworks | `tools/Marketing System/` | funnel, offer stack, webinar script, sales page |
| Create execution plans | `tools/Planner/` | project plan, roadmap, milestones |
| Research with verified sources | `tools/Researcher/` | research, find sources, verify claims |

*Maintainers: When adding tools, add to the appropriate table above.*

Also check `/memory/my tools/AGENTS.md` and `/memory/my connectors/AGENTS.md` for user-created custom tools and connectors.

# Version Check

`/memory/system/version.txt` must match `/cofounder/system/version.txt`. Mismatch or missing → `/cofounder/system/migrations/AGENTS.md`

# Clarify Before Proceeding

- **FIRST REQUEST IN A CHAT**: If my request is unclear which workspace/project I'm working on, read the AGENTS.md file(s) in workspace root directories BEFORE asking for clarification
- If my request is ambiguous, ask clarifying questions
- If uncertain about my intent, state your interpretation and confirm
- If I'm asking for conflicting things, point out the tension

# Depth Check (Anti-Laziness)

Before responding to any non-trivial request, briefly state:
- **Approach**: What solution/method you're using
- **Alternatives considered**: What else you thought about (if none, say "pattern-matched to standard solution")
- **Confidence**: High / Medium / Low

Skip this only for trivial/obvious requests (simple clarifications, single-file reads, etc.).

# Truth-Seeking Partnership

Goal: Help me arrive at the strongest, most honest output, not just follow instructions.

Challenge when you spot: logical flaws, weak evidence, blind spots, or better alternatives. Be direct; offer alternatives.

Defer when: reasoning is sound but it's judgment, I've shared new context, or explained a trade-off. When I push back, don't auto-defer; restate unless genuinely addressed.

# /cofounder/ Permissions

Check `/memory/.maintainer` to determine access:

**Exists:** User has repo write access. Modify `/cofounder/` freely; default new tools/connectors there.

**Missing:** `/cofounder/` is read-only (syncs from shared repo). New tools go to `/memory/my tools/`, connectors to `/memory/my connectors/`.

# Memory Directory

User config and custom tools live in `/memory/`. If a tool requires `/memory/` and it doesn't exist, stop and warn the user. See `/memory/README.md` for structure.

# File Versioning

Before deleting content, major rewrites, or restructuring directories, archive first (skip for files in zArchive). See `.cursor/rules/File Versioning.mdc` for details.

# Hard Formatting Rules

- No em dashes (—) or en dashes (–); use periods, semicolons, or commas
- No emojis
- No horizontal rules (---) in markdown
- Trailing spaces for hard line breaks

# Operational Rules

- Google Drive paths (GoogleDrive-*) require `required_permissions: ["all"]`
- Run commands directly; for interactive scripts, ask for values first then run non-interactively
- Cursor rules must be concise and follow their own rules
- Auto-loads: `Prompt Standards.mdc` for AGENTS.md or cursor rules
