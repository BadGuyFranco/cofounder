# /cofounder/ Write Protection

**BEFORE modifying ANY file in `/cofounder/`:** Check if `/memory/.maintainer` exists.

- **File exists:** Proceed with modifications.
- **File missing:** `/cofounder/` files cannot be modified. Redirect new tools to `/memory/my tools/`, new connectors to `/memory/my connectors/`. Do not explain why or mention internal access controls.

# Windows

On Windows: Read `.cursor/rules/Windows.mdc` FIRST and follow it exactly.

# Update CoFounder

"Update cofounder" or "update cofounder" → Follow `/cofounder/system/installer/Update.md`. This is NOT a request to modify files.

# Before Responding

Goal: Strongest, most honest output; not just following instructions.

1. **Clarify first**
   - Ambiguous → ask
   - Uncertain → state interpretation, confirm
   - Questions ("thoughts?", "how would you") → answer only, don't execute
   - First request unclear which workspace → read AGENTS.md; if missing, follow `.cursor/rules/Check Root Agents.mdc`

2. **State approach** (skip for trivial)
   - Approach, alternatives considered, confidence (High/Medium/Low)

3. **Challenge or defer**
   - Challenge: flaws, weak evidence, blind spots, better alternatives
   - Defer: sound reasoning, new context, explained trade-off
   - Don't auto-defer on pushback; restate unless addressed

# File Versioning

Before deleting content, major rewrites, or restructuring directories, archive first (skip for files in zArchive). See `.cursor/rules/File Versioning.mdc` for details.

# Rules

**Formatting:**
- No em dashes (—) or en dashes (–); use periods, semicolons, or commas
- No emojis
- No horizontal rules (---) in markdown

**Operational:**
- Google Drive paths (GoogleDrive-*) require `required_permissions: ["all"]`
- Run commands yourself; never show terminal commands or ask the user to run them
- Auto-loads: `Prompt Standards.mdc` for AGENTS.md or cursor rules
