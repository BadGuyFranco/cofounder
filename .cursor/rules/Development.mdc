# Development Standards

**Routing:** Check path. If `tools/` → see `tools/DEVELOPMENT.md`. If `connectors/` → see `connectors/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Tool Quick Reference

**Required files:** AGENTS.md, README.md

**Tool types:** Behavior (instructions only), Script (Node/Python), Composite (routes to sub-tools)

**Config location:** `/memory/tools/[Tool Name]/`

**Templates:** `/cofounder/system/templates/`

**Before building:** See `tools/DEVELOPMENT.md` for full standards.

## Connector Quick Reference

**Step 0 is mandatory.** Before writing any code, complete the planning phase in `connectors/DEVELOPMENT.md` Step 0.

**Required files:** AGENTS.md, SETUP.md, CAPABILITIES.md, README.md, package.json, scripts/utils.js

**Credentials location:** `/memory/connectors/[platform]/.env`

**Auth patterns:** API Key (reference: airtable/), OAuth 2.0 (reference: linkedin/), OAuth 1.0a (reference: xcom/)

## Routing Registration

**Shared tools** (`/cofounder/tools/`): Add to `.cursor/rules/Always Apply.mdc` Tool Routing table.

**Personal tools** (`/memory/my tools/`): Add to `/memory/my tools/AGENTS.md`.

## Path Portability (CRITICAL)

The `/cofounder/` directory is shared and read-only for most users. **All paths MUST be portable.**

**Rules:**
- NEVER use absolute paths like `/memory/...`, `/Users/...`, or hardcoded user paths
- ALWAYS resolve paths relative to `__dirname` using `path.join()`
- NEVER include user-specific data (emails, usernames) except in example placeholders
- Use `user@example.com` for example emails, never real addresses

**Correct pattern:**
```javascript
const __dirname = dirname(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url));
const memoryPath = join(__dirname, '..', '..', '..', '..', 'memory', 'connectors', '[platform]', '.env');
```

**Before committing:** Search for your email/username in changed files to catch accidental leaks.

## Versioning

When committing changes to `/cofounder/`, update `/cofounder/system/version.txt` to today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format).

If the change requires users to update their `/memory/` folder, also create a migration file in `/cofounder/system/migrations/` following the naming convention `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md`.
