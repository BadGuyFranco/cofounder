# Development Standards

**Routing:** Check path. If `tools/` → see `tools/DEVELOPMENT.md`. If `connectors/` → see `connectors/DEVELOPMENT.md`.

## Tool Quick Reference

**Required files:** AGENTS.md, README.md

**Tool types:** Behavior (instructions only), Script (Node/Python), Composite (routes to sub-tools)

**Config location:** `/memory/[Tool Name]/`

**Templates:** `/cofounder/system/templates/`

**Before building:** See `tools/DEVELOPMENT.md` for full standards.

## Connector Quick Reference

**Step 0 is mandatory.** Before writing any code, complete the planning phase in `connectors/DEVELOPMENT.md` Step 0.

**Required files:** AGENTS.md, SETUP.md, CAPABILITIES.md, README.md, package.json, scripts/utils.js

**Credentials location:** `/memory/Connectors/[platform]/.env`

**Auth patterns:** API Key (reference: airtable/), OAuth 2.0 (reference: linkedin/), OAuth 1.0a (reference: xcom/)
