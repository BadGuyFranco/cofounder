# Windows Platform Requirements

## Terminal

Use Git Bash for all terminal commands. Do NOT use PowerShell or cmd.exe.

Git Bash is installed with Git for Windows: https://gitforwindows.org

If Git Bash is not installed, stop and tell the user to install it before proceeding with any terminal operations.
