Coding standards and architecture patterns to follow when building projects.

## Available Standards

## When to Use

Load the relevant standard when building new projects. These provide architecture patterns, coding conventions, and templates that ensure consistency.

Standards are not tools; they don't do things for you. They define HOW to do things.
